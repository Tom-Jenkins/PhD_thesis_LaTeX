abstract = {Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) have spread swiftly across the Western Atlantic, producing a marine predator invasion of unparalleled speed and magnitude. There is growing concern that lionfish will affect the structure and function of invaded marine ecosystems, however detrimental impacts on natural communities have yet to be measured. Here we document the response of native fish communities to predation by lionfish populations on nine coral reefs off New Providence Island, Bahamas. We assessed lionfish diet through stomach contents analysis, and quantified changes in fish biomass through visual surveys of lionfish and native fishes at the sites over time. Lionfish abundance increased rapidly between 2004 and 2010, by which time lionfish comprised nearly 40{\%} of the total predator biomass in the system. The increase in lionfish abundance coincided with a 65{\%} decline in the biomass of the lionfish's 42 Atlantic prey fishes in just two years. Without prompt action to control increasing lionfish populations, similar effects across the region may have long-term negative implications for the structure of Atlantic marine communities, as well as the societies and economies that depend on them.},

abstract = {Genomics promises exciting advances towards the important conservation goal of maximizing evolutionary potential, notwithstanding associated challenges. Here, we explore some of the complexity of adaptation genetics and discuss the strengths and limitations of genomics as a tool for characterizing evolutionary potential in the context of conservation management. Many traits are polygenic and can be strongly influenced by minor differences in regulatory networks and by epigenetic variation not visible in DNA sequence. Much of this critical complexity is difficult to detect using methods commonly used to identify adaptive variation, and this needs appropriate consideration when planning genomic screens, and when basing management decisions on genomic data. When the genomic basis of adaptation and future threats are well understood, it may be appropriate to focus management on particular adaptive traits. For more typical conservations scenarios, we argue that screening genome-wide variation should be a sensible approach that may provide a generalized measure of evolutionary potential that accounts for the contributions of small-effect loci and cryptic variation and is robust to uncertainty about future change and required adaptive response(s). The best conservation outcomes should be achieved when genomic estimates of evolutionary potential are used within an adaptive management framework.},

The increase in metabolic rate with temperature explains substantial among-species variation in life-history traits, population dynamics, and ecosystem processes. Temperature can also cause variability in metabolic rate within species. Here, we compare the effect of temperature on a key component of marine life cycles among a geographically and taxonomically diverse group of marine fish and invertebrates. Although innumerable lab studies document the negative effect of temperature on larval development time, little is known about the generality versus taxon-dependence of this relationship. We present a unified, parameterized model for the temperature dependence of larval development in marine animals. Because the duration of the larval period is known to influence larval dispersal distance and survival, changes in ocean temperature could have a direct and predictable influence on population connectivity, community structure, and regional-to-global scale patterns of biodiversity.},

abstract = {The American lobster supports the most economically valuable fishery in the Gulf of Maine and Atlantic Canada. Across much of its range, ocean temperatures have increased at rates faster than almost anywhere in the world. Studies of warming effects on larvae have largely focused on survival and development, but rarely have examined sub-lethal effects that could influence settlement and subsequent recruitment to the fishery. We explored how warming influences rate of development, survival, stress, and developmental stability of larval lobsters reared under four nominal temperatures: 14, 16, 18, and 22 Â°C. Our study is the first to evaluate the use of fluctuating asymmetry as a biomarker for developmental instability in larval American lobster. We also recorded total hemocyte counts in postlarvae as an indicator of stress, a novel technique for work in larval lobster. Development proceeded significantly faster as temperature increased, and cumulative survival was significantly positively correlated with temperature. However, postlarvae reared under temperature extremes exhibited elevated hemocyte counts and had significantly lower levels of variance in midline asymmetry compared to intermediate temperature groups. Together, this suggests that warmer temperatures may facilitate faster growth at the expense of increased physiological stress and a loss of genetic diversity, potentially affecting the species' ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Fluctuating asymmetry could prove to be a useful bioindicator for population resilience.},

This suggests that strong density-dependent mortality operates at the juvenile settling stage, and we indicate how such mortality might be incorporated into a simple model of the Nephrops life cycle. Dispersal of pelagic larvae away from the mud areas suitable for settling may reduce the number of organisms that settle on the sea floor.

abstract = {Conservation biologists routinely face the dilemma of keeping small, fragmented populations isolated, wherein inbreeding depression may ensue, or mixing such populations, which may exacerbate population declines via outbreeding depression. The joint evaluation of inbreeding and outbreeding risks in the wild cannot be readily conducted in endangered species, so a suggested 'safe' strategy is to mix ecologically and genetically similar populations. To evaluate this strategy, we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment involving three neighboring populations of endangered Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) now bred in captivity and maintained in captive and wild environments. Pure, inbred, and outbred (first and second generation) cross types were released and recaptured in the wild to simultaneously test for local adaptation, inbreeding depression, and outbreeding depression. We found little evidence of inbreeding depression after one generation of inbreeding and little evidence of either heterosis or outbreeding depression via genetic incompatibilities after one or two generations of outbreeding. A trend for outbreeding depression via the loss of local adaptation was documented in one of three populations. The effects of inbreeding were not significantly different from the effects of outbreeding. Hence, at the geographic scale evaluated (34-50 km), inbreeding for one generation and outbreeding over two generations may have similar effects on the persistence of small populations. The results further suggested that outbreeding outcomes may be highly variable or unpredictable at small genetic distances. Our work highlights the necessity of evaluating the relative costs of inbreeding and outbreeding in the conservation and management of endangered species on a case-by-case basis.},

abstract = {Molecular adaptation is typically assumed to proceed by sequential fixation of beneficial mutations. In diploids, this picture presupposes that for most adaptive mutations, the homozygotes have a higher fitness than the heterozygotes. Here, we show that contrary to this expectation, a substantial proportion of adaptive mutations should display heterozygote advantage. This feature of adaptation in diploids emerges naturally from the primary importance of the fitness of heterozygotes for the invasion of new adaptive mutations. We formalize this result in the framework of Fisher's influential geometric model of adaptation. We find that in diploids, adaptation should often proceed through a succession of short-lived balanced states that maintain substantially higher levels of phenotypic and fitness variation in the population compared with classic adaptive walks. In fast-changing environments, this variation produces a diversity advantage that allows diploids to remain better adapted compared with haploids despite the disadvantage associated with the presence of unfit homozygotes. The short-lived balanced states arising during adaptive walks should be mostly invisible to current scans for long-term balancing selection. Instead, they should leave signatures of incomplete selective sweeps, which do appear to be common in many species. Our results also raise the possibility that balancing selection, as a natural consequence of frequent adaptation, might play a more prominent role among the forces maintaining genetic variation than is commonly recognized.},

abstract = {Fish aquaculture for commodity production, fisheries enhancement and conservation is expanding rapidly, with many cultured species undergoing inadvertent or controlled domestication. Cultured fish are frequently released, accidentally and deliberately, into natural environments where they may survive well and impact on wild fish populations through ecological, genetic, and technical interactions. Impacts of fish released accidentally or for fisheries enhancement tend to be negative for the wild populations involved, particularly where wild populations are small, and/or highly adapted to local conditions, and/or declining. Captive breeding and supplementation can play a positive role in restoring threatened populations, but the biology of threatened populations and the potential of culture approaches for conserving them remain poorly understood. Approaches to the management of domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions are often ad hoc, fragmented and poorly informed by current science. We develop an integrative biological framework for understanding and managing domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions. The framework sets out how management practices in culture and for cultured fish in natural environments affect domestication processes, interactions between cultured and wild fish, and outcomes in terms of commodity production, fisheries yield, and conservation. We also develop a typology of management systems (specific combinations of management practices in culture and in natural environments) that are likely to provide positive outcomes for particular management objectives and situations. We close by setting out avenues for further research that will simultaneously improve fish domestication and management of cultured-wild fish interactions and provide key insights into fundamental biology.},

By reconstructing a three-generation pedigree with microsatellite markers, we show that genetic effects of domestication reduce subsequent reproductive capabilities by approximately 40{\%} per captive-reared generation when fish are moved to natural environments. These results suggest that even a few generations of domestication may have negative effects on natural reproduction in the wild and that the repeated use of captive-reared parents to supplement wild populations should be carefully reconsidered.},

abstract = {A restocking program to enhance European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) started at Kvitsoy in southwestern Norway in 1990, and during 5 years 128000 cultured juveniles were released. The goal was to increase recruitment, and assess whether the collapsed stock could be rehabilitated on a long-term basis. Commercial harvest showed a steady increase in frequency of cultured lobsters, and since 1998, released lobsters have accounted for 50-60{\%} of the landings. By 2001 about 25 000 lobsters were checked and 7950 positively identified as cultured. Of these, more than 1500 were berried females. Since 1997, total recapture of stocked lobsters has increased from 2.4 to 6.2{\%}. The overall conclusion is that hatchery-reared lobsters survive after release, and represent a supplement to the spawning stock. Catch per pot lift indirectly demonstrates restocking/enhancement rather than replacement.

However, a growing body of experimental studies indicates that adaptive differentiation occurs in numerous marine invertebrates in response to selection imposed by strong gradients (and more complex mosaics) of abiotic and biotic conditions. Moreover, a surprisingly high proportion of the marine invertebrates known or suspected of exhibiting local adaptation are species with planktonic dispersal. Adaptive divergence among populations can occur over a range of spatial scales, including those that are fine-grained (i.e., meters to kilometers), reflecting a balance between scales of gene flow and selection. Addressing the causes and consequences of adaptive genetic differentiation among invertebrate populations promises to advance community ecology, climate change research, and the effective management of marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {When incompletely isolated taxa coexist in a patchy environment (e.g. mosaic hybrid zones, host-race complexes), patterns of variation may differ between selected traits/genes and neutral markers. While the genetic structure of selected traits/loci tends to coincide with habitat variables (producing Genetic-Environment Association or GEA), genetic differentiation at neutral loci unlinked to any selected locus rather depends on geographic connectivity at a large scale (e.g. Isolation- By-Distance or IBD), although these loci often display GEA at a small scale. This discrepancy has been repeatedly taken as evi- dence for parallel primary divergence driven by local adaptation. We argue that this interpretation needs to be addressed more thoroughly by considering the alternative hypothesis that speciation was initiated in allopatry and secondary introgression has subsequently erased the signal of past differentiation at neutral loci. We present a model of neutral introgression after secondary contact in a mosaic hybrid zone, which describes how GEAs dissipate with time and how neutral variation self-organizes accord- ing to the environmental and geographic structures. We show that although neutral loci can be affected by environmental selection, they are often more affected by history and connectivity: the neutral structure retains the initial geographic separation more than it correlates with the environment during the colonization and introgression phases, and then converges to a migration-drift balance, the most frequent outcome of which is GEA at a local scale but IBD at a large scale. This is the exact pattern usually attributed to parallel ecological speciation. Introgression is heterogeneous in space and depends on the landscape structure (e.g. it is faster in small patches, which are more impacted by immigration). Furthermore, there is no directionality in the association and it is possi- ble to observe reversed GEAs between distant regions. We argue that the history of differentiation should ideally be reconstructed with selected loci or neutral loci linked to them, not neutral ones, and review some case studies for which the hypothesis of a long co-existence of co-adapted genetic backgrounds might have been refuted too hastily.},

Genome-wide comparisons between closely related species have revealed the existence of heterogeneous divergence patterns, dominated by genomic islands of increased divergence supposed to contain reproductive isolation loci. However, this divergence landscape only provides a static picture of the dynamic process of speciation, during which confounding mechanisms unrelated to speciation can interfere. Here we use haplotype-resolved whole-genome sequences to identify the mechanisms responsible for the formation of genomic islands between Atlantic and Mediterranean sea bass lineages. Local ancestry patterns show that genomic islands first emerged in allopatry through linked selection acting on a heterogeneous recombination landscape. Then, upon secondary contact, preexisting islands were strongly remolded by differential introgression, revealing variable fitness effects among regions involved in reproductive isolation. Interestingly, we find that divergent regions containing ancient polymorphisms conferred the strongest resistance to introgression.},

We observed different geographic and bathymetric distributions, and contrasted phylogeography among species. Ophiothrix fragilis appeared genetically isolated between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins, attributed to past vicariance during Pleistocene glaciations and a secondary contact associated to demographic expansion. This contrasts with the panmixia observed in Ophiothrix sp. II across the Atlantic-Mediterranean area. Results were not conclusive for Ophiothrix sp.

abstract = {Aim A central question in evolutionary ecology is the nature of environmental barriers that can limit gene flow and induce population genetic divergence, a first step towards speciation. Here we study the geographical barrier constituted by the transition zone between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, using as our model Cymodocea nodosa, a seagrass distributed throughout the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic, from central Portugal to Mauritania. We also test predictions about the genetic footprints of Pleistocene glaciations. Location The AtlanticMediterranean transition region and adjacent areas in the Atlantic (Mauritania to south-west Portugal) and the Mediterranean. Methods We used eight microsatellite markers to compare 20 seagrass meadows in the Atlantic and 27 meadows in the Mediterranean, focusing on the transition between these basins. Results Populations from these two regions form coherent groups containing several unique, high-frequency alleles for the Atlantic and for the Mediterranean, with some admixture west of the AlmeriaOran Front (Portugal, south-west Spain and Morocco). These are populations where only one or a few genotypes were found, for all but Cadiz, but remarkably still show the footprint of a contact zone. This extremely low genotypic richness at the Atlantic northern edge contrasts with the high values (low clonality) at the Atlantic southern edge and in most of the Mediterranean. The most divergent populations are those at the higher temperature range limits: the southernmost Atlantic populations and the easternmost Mediterranean, both potential footprints of vicariance. Main conclusions A biogeographical transition region occurs close to the AlmeriaOran front. A secondary contact zone in Atlantic Iberia and Morocco results from two distinct dispersal sources: the Mediterranean and southernmost Atlantic populations, possibly during warmer interglacial or post-glacial periods. The presence of high-frequency diagnostic alleles in present-day disjunct populations from the southernmost Atlantic region indicates that their separation from all remaining populations is ancient, and suggests an old, stable rear edge.},

These studies have also shown that a strong ocean front is present between Almeria, Spain, and Oran, Algeria, which is Part of the easternmost segment of the Eastern Alboran Gyre. Based on these satellite studies, the first in situ investigation of the front, aled here the Almeria-Oran Front, was conducted in March 1986 as part of the winter campaign of the Western Mediterranean Circulation Experiment (WMCE). Analyses of the resulting data show that the Alnueia-Owa Front is a larg-scale density front, formed by the convergence of two distinct water masses and controlled by the geographic position and strength of the Eastern Alboran Gyre. Physical and biochemical dat indicate that the front as limited to the upper 300 m, with a strong southwvard baroclinicet. The secondary ageastrophic circulation is characterized by surface convergence, along- isopycnal sinings and upwelling on the western side of the front.},

abstract = {Existing techniques for estimating natural fluctuations of sea level and global ice-volume from the recent geological past exploit fossil coral-reef terraces or oxygen-isotope records from benthic foraminifera. Fossil reefs reveal the magnitude of sea-level peaks (highstands) of the past million years, but fail to produce significant values for minima (lowstands) before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) about 20,000 years ago, a time at which sea level was about 120 m lower than it is today1, 2, 3, 4. The isotope method provides a continuous sea-level record for the past 140,000 years (ref. 5) (calibrated with fossil-reef data6), but the realistic uncertainty in the sea-level estimates is around 20 m. Here we present improved lowstand estimatesâextending the record back to 500,000 years before presentâusing an independent method based on combining evidence of extreme high-salinity conditions in the glacial Red Sea with a simple hydraulic control model of water flow through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandab, which links the Red Sea to the open ocean. We find that the world can glaciate more intensely than during the LGM by up to an additional 20-m lowering of global sea-level. Such a 20-m difference is equivalent to a change in global ice-volume of the order of today's Greenland and West Antarctic ice-sheets.},

abstract = {At present, one of two strategies is employed by fisheries managers for enhancing wild stocks of homarid lobsters using hatchery-reared individuals. The first is repeated releases of large numbers ({\textgreater} 5000 at a time) of postlarvae (stage IV and V; carapace length [CL] = 5-7 mm) to selected bottom locations. This option exists primarily because these programs lack space, time, and/or the finances to rear animals to larger sizes that would most likely have initially higher survival rates. The second is to rear animals in the laboratory for 5-8 months to stage XII+ (CL = 12-16 mm) and then release small numbers ({\textless} 1000) of these relatively large juveniles. To date there has been no attempt to release large numbers of relatively large juveniles because the costs are too prohibitive. We have developed a low-cost, low-maintenance, field-based nursery caging system for rearing cultured lobsters, \textit{Homarus gammarus} (L). Individuals (780 and ranging in CL from 5.2 to 7.2 mm) were reared in pre-fouled and unfouled containers (360 cm3) fabricated from an extruded plastic netting (3.2 mm aperture) and in pre-fouled plastic petri dishes (200 cm3) that were deployed in five near-bottom cages for 10 months (September 2000 to June 2001) at two subtidal sites located in a shallow, relatively exposed embayment on the west coast of Ireland. Animals apparently were able to survive and grow by suspension feeding on the plankton and/or foraging on the fouling community that settled on and within individual containers. Mean recovery rate (Â± 95{\%} CI) was independent of a priori fouling treatments, but was site-specific (42.1 Â± 7.9{\%} and 27.8 Â± 13.7{\%}; n=5). These rates are minimal estimates of survival because we found that at least 20{\%} of the animals were capable of escaping from the mesh containers. Mean recovery in petri dishes that prohibited emigration was 53.3 Â± 37.02{\%} at one site and 75.0 Â± 23.1{\%} (n=5) at the other. These recovery rates compare favorably with survival rates of fed conspecifics held in the laboratory over the same time (54/ 81=66.7{\%}). At the end of the experiment, animals in field cages had mean CLs that were significantly smaller than the fed controls. Because of costs incurred with maintaining small lobsters under laboratory conditions, results of this short-term, manipulative field experiment indicate that field-based nurseries represent an economically viable, third option for managers of lobster stock enhancement programs. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Norwegian fishery for the European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) collapsed between 1960 and 1980, to 90{\%} of the females. A small number moulted and spawned a few weeks after hatching. More than 95{\%} of the recaptures were taken within a radius of 1 km of the release area. Egg production varied considerably between seasons. Reproductive potential (RP) of landed berried females underestimated egg production compared with what was actually produced (AE). For the entire period, RP was estimated to be about 15.0 million eggs, and AE to be 17.2 million eggs. Cultured females contributed 27{\%} of AE. To reduce the fishing mortality in a heavily fished and depleted population is vital. A ban on landing berried females would be a valuable first step in attempting to increase the spawning biomass.},

abstract = {The northernmost self-sustaining popu- lations of European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) are found north of the Arctic Circle (66Â°33'N), in Tysfjord and Nordfolda, two large, deep, and relatively warm fjord systems in northern Norway. In contrast to most other Norwegian lobster populations, these genetically distinct populations are still found at relative high densities. This paper presents results from surveys conducted in the fjord systems in 1964-65 and between 1992 to 2005, and compares reproductive characteristics, morphology, growth, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). The lobster population in Stefjord, one of four individual fjords in the Tysfjord fjord system, was characterised by a small mean carapace length (CL, 78Â±11 mm SD), and less than 18{\%} of the catches were larger than the minimum legal size of 88 mm CL. Growth rates were also low, with an average increment per moult of 4.0 Â± 0.9 mm CL for females and 5.6 Â± 2.1 mm for males. The crusher claw increased on average 5.5 Â± 2.3 mm at each moult in females, and 11.2 Â± 7.6 mm in males. The smallest ovigerous female was 62 mm CL, and more than 60{\%} of females above 66 mm CL were berried (egg-bearing). In contrast, lobster in the Nordfolda fjord system were larger, with more than 75{\%} of the catch larger than minimum legal size, and the smallest ovigerous female was 76 mm CL. Males in Nordfolda increased on average 8.3 Â± 2.4 mm in CL at each moult. Lobster populations in the area of the midnight sun (24-h daylight during summer) were also morphologically different from lobster off southwestern Norway in crusher claw length for males and abdominal width for females. There were no differences in the size distribution or CPUE between the surveys in 1964-65 and between 1992 and 2005, leading to the conclusion that population density seemed to be relatively stable. The average density in the fjord systems of Tysfjord and Nordfolda was 155 Â± 76 lobsters and average weight was 71 Â± 26 kg per km shoreline in the main survey areas. The adaptation to a sub-arctic environment has resulted in geneticlly distinct populations as well as slightly altered biology and behaviour. Our assessment suggests that the populations are vulnerable to exploitation, and conservation plans should be elaborated.},

abstract = {The re-stocking or enhancement of Homarid populations has been the focus of several research projects in recent years. However, despite being able to successfully rear lobsters in captivity, there are few reports of newly settled European lobsters (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) in the wild. This is of serious concern for fishery managers when trying to ascertain if restocking or enhancement programmes are successful at the fishery level. Based on published work from the western Atlantic seaboard, cobble and boulder substrata have been identified as an important nursery habitat for early benthic phase (EBP) American lobsters (Homarus americanus). This paper, based on an E.U. funded research project (LEAR), describes the results of quantitative airlift suction sampling from cobble habitat in Norway, Ireland the U.K., and Italy. In total, 67 m2 of cobble was sampled, but no EBP lobsters were found. Overall, crustaceans and molluscs were the most abundant species in all countries, While the collective densities of animals per m2 of cobble were similar to that of the United States, the species diversity in Europe was noticeably higher. Among the crustacea, the reptant decapods dominated at all sites. These findings tend to support the modern day 'exclusion hypothesis' that competition and predation from other species limits the successful recruitment of EBP European lobster to the benthos. The results highlight the need to go beyond the single species approach to understanding the factors that influence the recruitment of \textit{Homarus gammarus}.},

abstract = {In censuses conducted between 1989 and 1993 the cause of consistent local differences in benthic recruitment of the American lobster (Homarus americanus Milne-Edwards) to coastal sites in Maine was unclear. Field experiments were conducted to assess the role of pre- and post-settlement processes in causing high and low extremes in recruitment on opposite sides of an outer coastal island in our study area. The west side of the island has some of the highest population densities measured in New England. Our results indicate that postlarval supply determines these differences in recruitment between the two sites. Standardized replicate cobble plots deployed on each side of the island ruled out habitat differences as an explanation for these differences because they exhibited the same east-west difference in recruitment as the natural habitat. We also ruled out differing rates of post-settlement loss because we recovered previously marked and released settlers in equal numbers in similar plots from both sites. The distribution of neustonic postlarvae and hydrographic evidence indicate that wind-driven surface transport produces an asymmetric postlarval supply to the two sides of the island during the settlement season. Differences in the degree of asymmetry from year to year correspond to differences in the magnitude of eastward transport. We also conducted experiments at the site receiving high recruitment to assess whether new recruits or older year classes were near the saturation of cobble habitat for these animals. The combination of saturation seeding trials, using hatchery-reared lobsters, and weekly counts of natural recruits and immigrants suggests that lobsters may become increasingly subject to crowding as they grow. Movements away from the initial settlement site, probably in part caused by crowding tend to smooth the inequality in population density which is set initially by postlarval supply.},

In the first set of experiments, newly hatched larvae (stage I) were raised in separate family tanks. All larvae groups survived to stage III/IV, although large variation in relative survival was observed among families within each of the three different female groups. Highest overall survival was observed for the RW group (12.8{\%}), whereas no differences in overall survival were found between the KW (9.0{\%}) and KC groups (9.6{\%}). From stage III/IV, larvae from singlegarden" juvenile experiments. These lasted for 9 months, and the surviving juveniles were identified to family/female group using microsatellite DNA profiling. Significantly higher survival of the KW families (7.0{\%}) was found compared with the KC (3.7{\%}) and the RW families (3.2{\%}), and differences in family ranking of relative survival values were evident between the KW and KC groups. The relative survival rate of the different groups was independent of female lobster size. An estimate based on only stage IV larvae reduced the difference in survival between the KW (11.4{\%}) and KC (8.3{\%}) group. The experiments provided evidence that cultured females (KC) are producing viable offspring with lower, but comparable survival to that of offspring from wild females (KW). family tank experiments were mixed in five "common M08023; Online publication date 24 February 2009},

abstract = {A series of communal rearing experiments with European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}), performed in 1998 and 1999 at the Kvitsoy Lobster Hatchery in Norway, tested methods for future production of juveniles for farming and release purposes. Lobster larvae were raised from stage IV in tanks or cages with a bottom substrate of shell sand and a variety of shelters. Survival rates after 4-5 months ranged from 10-67{\%}; averages were 59{\%} in 1998 and 30{\%} in 1999. Final densities ranged from 29, to a maximum of 130 juveniles/m2; means were 72 in 1998 and 55 in 1999. As expected, the fastest growth was found in tanks with heated water (15-19 deg C), where mean carapace length (CL) was 17 mm after 4 months, compared to a mean CL of 11 mm in unheated water. Size at the end of the experiments was highly variable, even within the offspring from a single family, and especially in heated water. Lobsters raised communally were, in general, larger and more variable than were lobsters raised in single compartments.; averages were 59{\%} in 1998 and 30{\%} in 1999.

In an artificial water column, newly hatched larvae were positively phototactic to white light at intensities near 0.6 Âµmol m-2 s-1. The positive phototactic behaviour decreased with increasing larval age and stage. Accordingly, older larvae were mostly distributed away from the light source in deeper layers and near the bottom. The measured vertical swimming speed of newly hatched larvae was 4.6Â±0.5 cm s-1. Lobster larvae were positively rheotactic and thus able to swim against the current direction. The horizontal swimming ability of the larvae increased with stage from 0.7Â±1.0 cm s-1 (Zoea I) to about 1.5Â±0.9 cm s-1 (Zoea II) and 2.2Â±0.7 cm s-1 (Zoea III).

Fecundity of the European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) off southwestern Norway after stock enhancement; do cultured females produce as many eggs as wild females? â ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 164â170.An enhancement project with European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) began in 1990, and over the following 5 years some 128 000 hatchery-produced juveniles of average age about 9 months were released around the islands of Kvits{\o}y, southwestern Norway. Recaptures of reproductive female lobsters of cultured origin raised the question as to whether hatchery-reared females could perform as well as wild females in terms of egg production. A fecundity study therefore compared females of wild and cultured origin during autumn of 1996, and spring and autumn of 1997. No significant differences were found in size-specific fecundity (F = 0.0045 CL3.22; n = 215; r2 = 0.88; CL is carapace length), weight of egg mass, embryonic development, or egg size (diameter or dry weight). Further, the number of eggs produced per female was in the same range as it was about 90 years ago, i.e. before the local stock collapsed. There were no indications of significant differences in fecundity between seasons and therefore no egg loss for the incubation period from October 1996 to the end of May 1997. The results suggest that more eggs are produced by the larger females than in lobsters elsewhere in Europe, but compare well with American lobsters (H. americanus) of the same size range and living in the same temperature regime (off Newfoundland).},

abstract = {We redescribe the larval stages of the European lobster, \textit{Homarus gammarus}, based on autofluorescence composite imaging. We focus on larval stages (II) to (IV). Compared to the American lobster, Homarus americanus, differences are most apparent in stage (III). This stage appears more mature in H. gammarus; for example, the rostrum is already curved and bears spines, and the appendages are better developed and longer and more differentiated. In H. americanus stage (III) shows a stronger resemblance to stage (II). As a result of the morphology of stage (III), the âmetamorphicâmoult between stage (III) and stage (IV) in H. gammarus is less drastic than in H. americanus.Metamorphosis is characterised by two criteria. It involves (1) a drastic change in morphology in (2) a short amount of time. It has hence been suggested that a more pronounced metamorphosis evolves by two factors affecting these criteria, namely, (1) the evolution of specialised larval features, which increase the morphological disparity between larva and adult that makes the change of morphology more drastic, and (2) the skipping of entire stages.This means larval forms ancestrally moult over several intermediate forms into the definite adult morphology. Yet, in more derived forms the stages with intermediate morphologies are no longer expressed; highly specialized larvae moult into the adult within a single moult (in the most extreme case) hence bridging the morphologies of larvae and adult in a shorter amount of time. The example of the two Homarus species demonstrates that this explanation is not the only possible one. Additionally, differences of a single larval stage (in this case larval stage (III)) can lead to a more or less metamorphic-appearing ontogenetic sequence.},

abstract = {The exoskeletons of the American lobster Homarus americanus and of the edible crab Cancer pagurus were analysed with structural and chemical methods. The exoskeletons consist of crystalline magnesian calcite in the form of nanocrystals (domain size about 20 nm), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), and $\alpha$-chitin. The composition varies among different parts of the skeleton and also between the two species. Differences are related to the mechanical requirements and biological escape behaviour of the animals. The finger and claw are strongly mineralized and very hard. The shell of the body (the carapace) is less mineralized and more elastic. The lobster, as a mobile, fast-swimming animal, typically escapes from a predator whereas the crab clings to the ground and burrows into the sand. Consequently, the shell of the lobster is less mineralized (and therefore lighter and less hard) than the shell of the crab. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The common or brown shrimp Crangon crangon (L.) is a highly abundant and important taxon, both ecologically and commercially, yet knowledge on its population structure and historical biogeography is limited. We studied population genetic structure across the distribution range of this species by sequencing a 388 bp fragment of the cytochrome-c-oxidase I gene for 140 individuals from 25 locations. Strong population structuring and high levels of genetic diversity were observed. Four main phylogroups were uncovered: northeastern Atlantic, western Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea and Black Sea. Gene flow of these shrimp across known oceanographical barriers (e.g., the Strait of Gibraltar and/or Oran-Almeria front, Sicilian Straits, and Turkish Straits) is severely restricted. The oldest and most variable populations currently inhabit the western Mediterranean. The observed absence of structure across the entire northeastern Atlantic shelf is proposed not to be due to gene flow, but to relatively recent colonization following the glacial cycles of the late Pleistocene. Black Sea shrimp are currently disconnected from Mediterranean populations, and colonization is inferred, on the basis of coalescent analysis, to have happened relatively recently, but possibly earlier than 7000 years ago. We postulate the hypothesis that C. crangon survived the last brackish-water ({\textless}7â°) period inside the Black Sea and/or one of the adjacent inland seas. We conclude that (1) common shrimp populations from different basins are strongly differentiated, (2) gene flow across basins is probably very limited, and (3) the biogeographic history of the taxon is largely in accordance with the geographic history of its distribution range. This study provides further evidence that high population connectivity of marine species (e.g., by policy makers) should not be assumed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Inexpensive short-read sequencing technologies applied to reduced representation genomes is revolutionizing genetic research, especially population genetics analysis, by allowing the genotyping of massive numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for large numbers of individuals and populations. Restriction siteâassociated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a recent technique based on the characterization of genomic regions flanking restriction sites. One of its potential drawbacks is the presence of polymorphism within the restriction site, which makes it impossible to observe the associated SNP allele (i.e. allele dropout, ADO). To investigate the effect of ADO on genetic variation estimated from RAD markers, we first mathematically derived measures of the effect of ADO on allele frequencies as a function of different parameters within a single population. We then used RAD data sets simulated using a coalescence model to investigate the magnitude of biases induced by ADO on the estimation of expected heterozygosity and FST under a simple demographic model of divergence between two populations. We found that ADO tends to overestimate genetic variation both within and between populations. Assuming a mutation rate per nucleotide between 10â9 and 10â8, this bias remained low for most studied combinations of divergence time and effective population size, except for large effective population sizes. Averaging FST values over multiple SNPs, for example, by sliding window analysis, did not correct ADO biases. We briefly discuss possible solutions to filter the most problematic cases of ADO using read coverage to detect markers with a large excess of null alleles.},

abstract = {Climate change has a strong impact on marine ecosystems, including temperate species. Analysing the diversity of thermotolerance levels within species along with their genetic structure enables a better understanding of their potential response to climate change. We performed this integrative study on the Mediterranean octocoral Eunicella cavolini, with samples from different depths and by means of a common garden experiment. This species does not host photosynthetic Symbiodinium, enabling us to focus on the cnidarian response. We compared the thermotolerance of individuals from 20âm and 40âm depths from the same site and with replicates from the same colony. On the basis of an innovative statistical analysis of necrosis kinetics and risk, we demonstrated the occurrence of a very different response between depths at this local scale, with lower thermotolerance of deep individuals. Strongly thermotolerant individuals were observed at 20âm with necrosis appearing at higher temperatures than observed in situ. On the basis of nine microsatellite loci, we showed that these marked thermotolerance differences occur within a single population. This suggests the importance of acclimatization processes in adaptation to these different depths. In addition, differences between replicates demonstrated the occurrence of a variability of response between fragments from the same colony with the possibility of an interaction with a tank effect. Our results provide a basis for studying adaptation and acclimatization in Mediterranean octocorals in a heterogeneous environment.},

abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).},

abstract = {Without genetic variation, species cannot cope with changing environments, and evolution does not proceed. In endangered species, adaptive potential may be eroded by decreased population sizes and processes that further reduce gene flow such as philopatry and local adaptations. Here, we focused on the philopatric and endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting in Cape Verde as a model system to investigate the link between adaptive potential and philopatry. We produced a dataset of three complementary genomic regions to investigate female philopatric behaviour (mitochondrial DNA), male-mediated gene flow (microsatellites) and adaptive potential (major histocompatibility complex, MHC). Results revealed genetically distinct nesting colonies, indicating remarkably small-scale philopatric behaviour of females. Furthermore, these colonies also harboured local pools of MHC alleles, especially at the margins of the population's distribution, which are therefore important reserves of additional diversity for the population. Meanwhile, directional male-mediated gene flow from the margins of distribution sustains the adaptive potential for the entire rookery. We therefore present the first evidence for a positive association between philopatry and locally adapted genomic regions. Contrary to expectation, we propose that philopatry conserves a high adaptive potential at the margins of a distribution, while asymmetric gene flow maintains genetic connectivity with the rest of the population.},

In humans, five different numts cause genetic disease and a dozen human loci are polymorphic for the presence of numts, underscoring the rapid rate at which mitochondrial sequences reach the nucleus over evolutionary time. In the laboratory and in nature, numts enter the nuclear DNA via non-homolgous end joining (NHEJ) at double-strand breaks (DSBs). The frequency of numt insertions among 85 sequenced eukaryotic genomes reveal that numt content is strongly correlated with genome size, suggesting that the numt insertion rate might be limited by DSB frequency. Polymorphic numts in humans link maternally inherited mitochondrial genotypes to nuclear DNA haplotypes during the past, offering new opportunities to associate nuclear markers with mitochondrial markers back in time.},

abstract = {Molecular tools have become prominent in ecology and evolution. A target of choice for molecular ecologists and evolutionists is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whose many advantages have also convinced broad-scale, pragmatic programmes such as barcode initiatives. Of course, mtDNA is also of interest to human geneticists investigating mitochondrial diseases. Studies using mtDNA are however put at great risk by the inadvertent co-amplification or preferred amplification of nuclear pseudogenes (numts). A posteriori analysis of putative mtDNA sequences can help in removing numts but faces severe limitations (e.g. recently translocated numts will most of the time go unnoticed). Counter-measures taken a priori, i.e. explicitly designed for avoiding numt co-amplification or preferred amplification, are appealing but have never been properly assessed. Here we investigate the efficiency of four such measures (mtDNA enrichment, cDNA amplification, long-range amplification and pre-PCR dilution) on a common set of numt cases, showing that mtDNA enrichment is the worst performer while the use of pre-PCR dilution is a simple, yet robust method to prevent the pollution of putative mtDNA datasets with numts. Therefore, straightforward recommendations can be made that, if followed, will considerably increase the confidence in the mitochondrial origin of any mtDNA-like sequence. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.},

abstract = {It is widely assumed that the ability of an introduced species to acclimate to local environmental conditions determines its invasion success. The sea anemone Diadumene lineata is a cosmopolitan invader and shows extreme physiological tolerances. It was recently discovered in Kiel Fjord (Western Baltic Sea), although the brackish conditions in this area are physiologically challenging for most marine organisms. This study investigated salinity tolerance in D. lineata specimens from Kiel Fjord in order to assess potential geographical range expansion of the species in the Baltic Sea. In laboratory growth assays, we quantified biomass change and asexual reproduction rates under various salinity regimes (34: North Sea, 24: Kattegat, 14: Kiel Fjord, 7: Baltic Proper). Furthermore, we used H-NMR-based metabolomics to analyse intracellular osmolyte dynamics. Within four weeks D. lineata exhibited a fivefold population growth through asexual reproduction at high salinities (34 and 24). Biomass increase under these conditions was significantly higher (69 {\%}) than at a salinity of 14. At a salinity of 7, anemones ceased to reproduce asexually, their biomass decreased and metabolic depression was observed. Five main intracellular osmolytes were identified to be regulated in response to salinity change, with osmolyte depletion at a salinity of 7. We postulate that depletion of intracellular osmolytes defines a critical salinity ( S ) that determines loss of fitness. Our results indicate that D. lineata has the potential to invade the Kattegat and Skagerrak regions with salinity {\textgreater}10. However, salinities of the Baltic Proper (salinity {\textless}8) currently seem to constitute a physiological limit for the species.

abstract = {Adaptive genomics may help predicting how a species will respond to future environmental changes. Genomic signatures of local adaptation in marine organisms are often driven by environmental selective agents impacting the physiology of organisms. With one of the highest salinity level, the Mediterranean Sea provides an excellent model to investigate adaptive genomic divergence underlying salinity adaptation. In the present study, we combined six genome scan methods to detect potential genomic signal of selection in the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) populations distributed across a wide salinity gradient. We then blasted these outlier sequences on published fish genomic resources in order to identify relevant potential candidate genes for salinity adaptation in this species. Altogether, the six genome scan methods found 173 outliers out of 1153 SNPs. Using a blast approach, we discovered four candidate SNPs belonging to three genes potentially implicated in adaptation of M. surmuletus to salinity. The allele frequency at one of these SNPs significantly increases with salinity independently from the effect of longitude. The gene associated to this SNP, SOCS2, encodes for an inhibitor of cytokine and has previously been shown to be expressed under osmotic pressure in other marine organisms. Additionally, our results showed that genome scan methods not correcting for spatial structure can still be an efficient strategy to detect potential footprints of selection, when the spatial and environmental variation are confounded, and then, correcting for spatial structure in a second step represents a conservative method. The present outcomes bring evidences of potential genomic footprint of selection, which suggest an adaptive response of M. surmuletus to salinity conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Additional genomic data such as sequencing of a full-genome and transcriptome analyses of gene expression would provide new insights regarding the possibility that some striped red mullet populations are locally adapted to their saline environment.},

abstract = {Defining population structure and genetic diversity levels is of the utmost importance for developing efficient conservation strategies. Overfishing has caused mean annual catches of the European spiny lobster (Palinurus elephas) to decrease alarmingly along its distribution area. In this context, there is a need for comprehensive studies aiming to evaluate the genetic health of the exploited populations. The present study is based on a set of ten nuclear markers amplified in 331 individuals from ten different localities covering most of P. elephas distribution area. Samples from Atlantic and Mediterranean basins showed small but significant differences, indicating that P. elephas populations do not behave as a single panmictic unit but form two partially-overlapping groups. Despite intense overfishing, our dataset did not recover a recent bottleneck signal, and instead showed a large and stable historical effective size. This result could be accounted for by specific life-history traits (reproduction and longevity) and the limitations of molecular markers in covering recent timescales for nontemporal samples. The findings of the present study emphasize the need to integrate information on effective population sizes and life-history parameters when evaluating population connectivity levels from genetic data.

abstract = {An essential prerequisite of a sustainable fisheries management is the matching of biologically relevant processes and management action. In fisheries management and assessment, fish stocks are the fundamental biological unit, but the reasoning for the operational management unit is often indistinct and mismatches between the biology and the management action frequently occur. Despite the plethora of population genetic data on marine fishes, to date little or no use is made of the information, despite the fact that the detection of genetic differentiation may indicate reproduc- tively distinct populations. Here, we discuss key aspects of genetic population differentiation in the context of their importance for fisheries management. Furthermore, we evaluate the population structure of all 32 managed marine fish species in the north-east Atlantic and relate this structure to current management units and practice. Although a large number of studies on genetic population structure have been published in the last decades, data are still rare for most exploited species. The mismatch between genetic population structure and the current management units found for six species (Gadus morhua, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Merlangius merlangus, Micromesistius poutassou, Merluccius merluccius and Clupea harengus), emphasizes the need for a revision of these units and questions the appropriateness of current management measures. The implementation of complex and dynamic population structures into novel and less static management procedures should be a primary task for future fisheries management approaches.},

abstract = {Early hatching has been shown to be associated with increased survival of Norwegian spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) larvae. We investigated whether the process behind this association is related to larval drift and ambient temperature. A threedimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the effect of hatching date on northward displacement and temperature conditions of larvae from spawning grounds off western Norway for 1989â2008. The simulations revealed that the displacement during a period of 60 d was greatest if the larvae hatched early in the season and if they were located near the surface. The relationship between drift speed and ambient temperature was significantly negative, but less so later in the season, because the coastal current became progressively warmer. Results from the simulated interannual variations in larval drift compared with the observed survival suggest that a rapid northward displacement to the main nursery area in the Barents Sea is more important for larval survival than ambient temperature. The significant effect of northward displacement on survival could be explained by reduced overlap with predators and/or higher prey densities, but the causal processes involved remain to be investigated.},

abstract = {Marine reserves, areas closed to all forms of fishing, continue to be advocated and implemented to supplement fisheries and conserve populations [1-4]. However, although the reproductive potential of important fishery species can dramatically increase inside reserves [5-8], the extent to which larval offspring are exported and the relative contribution of reserves to recruitment in fished and protected populations are unknown [4, 9-11]. Using genetic parentage analyses, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for two species of exploited coral reef fish within a network of marine reserves on the Great Barrier Reef. In a 1,000 km2study area, populations resident in three reserves exported 83{\%} (coral trout, Plectropomus maculatus) and 55{\%} (stripey snapper, Lutjanus carponotatus) of assigned offspring to fished reefs, with the remainder having recruited to natal reserves or other reserves in the region. We estimate that reserves, which account for just 28{\%} of the local reef area, produced approximately half of all juvenile recruitment to both reserve and fished reefs within 30 km. Our results provide compelling evidence that adequately protected reserve networks can make a significant contribution to the replenishment of populations on both reserve and fished reefs at a scale that benefits local stakeholders. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Larval dispersal is the key process by which populations of most marine fishes and invertebrates are connected and replenished. Advances in larval tagging and genetics have enhanced our capacity to track larval dispersal, assess scales of population connectivity, and quantify larval exchange among no-take marine reserves and fished areas. Recent studies have found that reserves can be a significant source of recruits for populations up to 40 km away, but the scale and direction of larval connectivity across larger seascapes remain unknown. Here, we apply genetic parentage analysis to investigate larval dispersal patterns for two exploited coral reef groupers (Plectropomus maculatus and Plectropomus leopardus) within and among three clusters of reefs separated by 60â220 km within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. A total of 69 juvenile P. maculatus and 17 juvenile P. leopardus (representing 6{\%} and 9{\%} of the total juveniles sampled, respectively) were genetically assigned to parent individuals on reefs within the study area. We identified both short-distance larval dispersal within regions (200 m to 50 km) and long-distance, multidirectional dispersal of up to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}250 km among regions. Dispersal strength declined significantly with distance, with best-fit dispersal kernels estimating median dispersal distances of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}110 km for P. maculatus and {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}190 km for P. leopardus. Larval exchange among reefs demonstrates that established reserves form a highly connected network and contribute larvae for the replenishment of fished reefs at multiple spatial scales. Our findings highlight the potential for long-distance dispersal in an important group of reef fishes, and provide further evidence that effectively protected reserves can yield recruitment and sustainability benefits for exploited fish populations.},

abstract = {Many species have fragmented distribution with small isolated populations suffering inbreeding depression and/or reduced ability to evolve. Without gene flow from another population within the species (genetic rescue), these populations are likely to be extirpated. However, there have been only {\~{}} 20 published cases of such outcrossing for conservation purposes, likely a very low proportion of populations that would potentially benefit. As one impediment to genetic rescues is the lack of an overview of the magnitude and consistency of genetic rescue effects in wild species, I carried out a meta-analysis. Outcrossing of inbred populations resulted in beneficial effects in 92.9{\%} of 156 cases screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. The median increase in composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) following outcrossing was 148{\%} in stressful environments and 45{\%} in benign ones. Fitness benefits also increased significantly with maternal $\Delta$F (reduction in inbreeding coefficient due to gene flow), and for naturally outbreeding versus inbreeding species. However, benefits did not differ significantly among invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. Evolutionary potential for fitness characters in inbred populations also benefited from gene flow. There are no scientific impediments to the widespread use of outcrossing to genetically rescue inbred populations of naturally outbreeding species, provided potential crosses have a low risk of outbreeding depression. I provide revised guidelines for management of genetic rescue attempts. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Survival and duration of larval stages were recorded. Ovigerous females of M.caribbaeus were collected from the south-eastern coast of Margarita Island, Venezuela, and maintained in individual aquaria until hatching. Eggs from three of the females hatched in the laboratory. Larvae from each hatching were subdivided into groups of 10 and reared in plastic bowls containing 200 ml filtered and UV-irradiated sea water at different temperature-salinity combinations. Larvae were transferred daily to clean bowls with newly hatched Artemia nauplii, and the number of molts and mortality within each bowl was recorded. Complete larval development of M.caribbaeus occurred under all experimental conditions. Salinity had the greatest effect on percentage survival of each larval stage and complete development up to the first crab stage. The first zoeal stage exhibited the highest survival rate. Maximum survival for this stage occurred at 20 degrees C, 32-35 parts per thousand. Survival in the second zoeal stage and the megalopa was affected only by salinity. Effects of temperature and salinity on survival decreased with advance in development. The duration of the two zoeal stages, the megalopa, and development to the first crab stage showed a gradual reduction with increasing temperature. Salinity showed an effect on the duration of zoeal stages but not on the megalopal stage. Development from hatching to the first crab stage required 8-18 days, depending on the temperature-salinity combination, and was inversely related to temperature, averaging 14.3 days at 22 degrees C, 11.8 days at 25 degrees C and 9.2 days at 28 degrees C.},

abstract = {Diverging semi-isolated lineages either meet in narrow clinal hybrid zones, or have a mosaic distribution associated with environmental variation. Intrinsic reproductive isolation is often emphasized in the former and local adaptation in the latter, although both can contribute to isolation. Rarely these two patterns of spatial distribution are reported in the same study system, while this could provide fundamental information on the endless debate about the relative contribution of intrinsic reproductive isolation and local adaptation on the speciation process. Here we report that the low diversity long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus is genetically subdivided into five cryptic semi-isolated lineages. Along the Atlantic coasts, northern and southern lineages meet and coexist with little hybridization in the southwest of France, forming a clinal hybrid zone. In the Mediterranean Sea, two lineages have a mosaic distribution associated with lagoon-like and marine habitats. A fifth lineage was identified in the Black Sea. Genetic homogeneity over large spatial scales within each lineage, together with among-locus variance in differentiation levels between lineages and spatial patterns of introgression provide evidence that partial reproductive isolation is maintaining the divergence. Surprisingly, the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean lagoon lineages are genetically similar for a single chromosome-wide island showing parallel genetic differentiation among regions. Since Atlantic lineages distribution lacks association with habitat variation, genetic parallelism suggests that a shared genomic barrier contributes to reproductive isolation in contrasted contexts - i.e. spatial vs. ecological. We discuss how a genomic hotspot of parallel differentiation could have evolved and become associated either with space or with a patchy environment in a single study system.},

This paper seeks to correct that deficiency by investigating the values that lie behind the natural science of MPAs. With the aid of epistemic community, advocacy coalition and discourse coalition theories of policy networks, this article explores the role science and scientists have played in influencing policy on MPAs at the global and national level, and looks at the extent to which normative conceptualisations within and beyond natural science have influenced the debate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We studied the spatial connectedness of Natura 2000 site boundaries and the functional connectivity of the Natura 2000 network across the 34 terrestrial borders of the European Union. Connectivity was measured by the dispersal success of 192 reptile, amphibian, invertebrate and plant species from Annex II of the European Union Habitats Directive, based on the presence of same species on both sides of the borders. Connectedness and connectivity varied greatly between state borders, with good and bad examples found in all parts of the European Union. Connectedness and connectivity were positively correlated. However, a few outlying examples showed that good connectedness is not necessarily associated with good connectivity and that good connectivity is not always possible because of different habitats and/or different management on both sides of border. In 13 out of 34 borders the connectivity measure was 100{\%} and in 11 other borders it was over 50{\%}. Very few of the geographical and political factors tested to explain variation in connectedness and connectivity were significant. Better connectedness and connectivity, both at the border and site-pair level, was correlated with the rivers forming the border. The time since the designation of the second site in a site-pair was nearly significant, suggesting that connectivity might have always existed in nature but the 'documentation of it' required some time for additional site inventories. It seems that each country border has its own history with a unique subset of factors influencing Natura 2000 site selection and management thus generalising our findings to other international borders would be difficult. We did not find substantial differences in trans-boundary connectivity among taxonomic groups. The application of our method elsewhere in the World would perhaps bring interesting results at a large (continental or sub-continental) scale, provided that similar data are available. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Member States of the European Union are increasingly designating marine protected areas (MPAs) to meet globally agreed marine protection targets and regional commitments. A number of studies have examined the impact of the associated European policy on the representation of species and habitats but there is no comprehensive review of their combined impact on marine conservation in Europe. Here a systematic conservation planning framework is used to conduct such a review and compare the existing legislation to three elements of best practice, which are designed to identify MPA networks that achieve conservation goals whilst increasing the likelihood of implementation. In particular, this review investigates the extent to which legislation: (i) translates broad policy goals into explicit targets; (ii) incorporates socio-economic data into the planning process; and (iii) requires a social assessment. Whilst this legislation has widespread political support and has underpinned the rapid expansion of MPA networks, this review shows it largely fails to incorporate these key components from systematic conservation planning. Therefore, if European approaches to marine conservation are to fulfil their goal of halting marine biodiversity loss, it is essential they link existing policy frameworks with transparent strategies that account for local conditions and support implementation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Otolith chemistry has been widely used as a natural tag for determining environmental histories of fish that migrate across large distances and environmental gradients. However, it is not as well established as to whether otolith chemistry can be a useful tool for determining fine-scale movement and dispersal patterns of fish, particularly larvae, within estuaries. In this study, we collected water samples and otoliths from larvae of black bream, Acanthopagrus butcheri, an estuarine resident fish, and analyzed each for a suite of trace elements to determine the degree of spatio-temporal variability in elemental composition and which elements were incorporated into otoliths in relation to their associated water chemistry. We found that there were three distinct water layer signatures based on their Me : Cawater (Me = each element): a freshwater signature, a halocline signature, and a marine signature. There were also significant spatio-temporal patterns in Me : Caotolith, most notably for Li : Ca, K : Ca, and Mn : Ca. This study provides encouraging evidence for the utility of intra-estuary otolith chemistry to reconstruct environmental histories during larval development. This application will enable a better understanding of the abundance, timing, and duration of residency in particular water masses and locations that are important larval nursery habitats for species that develop within estuaries. {\textcopyright} 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography},

abstract = {1. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and networks of MPAs are being implemented globally as a spatial management tool for achieving conservation objectives. There has been considerable progress in reaching the prescribed 10{\%} protected area target for 2020, outlined in the Con- vention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 11 and the United Nations Sustainable Develop- ment Goal 14. 2. The application of MPA network design principles (e.g. Representative, ecological connectiv- ity), which underpin ecological coherence, is still lacking or insufficient in many regions. Poor ecological coherence hinders the ecological performance of MPA networks, leading to dys- function in the flow of ecosystem services and reduced ecosystem benefits, with potentially negative consequences for human wellâbeing. 3. This paper presents four pivotal focus points for future progress that can bridge the gap between ecological and social systems. The aim is to shift the discourse of âecological coher- ence' further into the social sphere, and hence support the alignment of the process of desig- nating ecologically coherent MPA networks with the âtriple bottom line' of economic development, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion, as described in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to achieve socialâecological coherence in MPA network design.},

abstract = {1.âThe juvenile stages of fish are often dependent on specific habitat types for their survival. Protecting these habitats may be crucial for maintaining strong adult stocks. The Natura 2000 network of the European Union offers protection of marine habitats that are essential for the recruitment of many fish species. By protecting these critical habitats the network may be important for maintaining the stocks of these fish species. 2.âWe present a spatially explicit, GIS-based, assessment of two important components of the ecological coherence of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks: representativity and connectivity. Representativity can be measured as the proportion of each conservation feature that is protected, whereas connectivity assesses the spatial configuration of the network. We apply these analyses to study the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network in a 30Â 000-km2 archipelago in the Baltic Sea, with respect to a coastal fish assemblage and associated habitats. The analyses are based on fish distribution maps that have been constructed by statistically relating life stage specific occurrence to environmental variables, and thereafter making spatial predictions based on maps of the environmental variables. 3.âThe map-based analyses show that both the representativity and the connectivity of the network are poor with respect to the studied fish species. In total, 3{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (11Â km2) of the assemblage recruitment habitat was protected and 48{\%} of the potentially connected habitats were included in the MPA network. 4.âThe assessment explicitly identified geographical areas, visually communicated using maps, where the network should be improved to ensure ecological coherence. 5.âSynthesis and applications.âMany MPA networks around the world, such as the Natura 2000 network in Europe, have recently come into effect. Establishment of the networks has often been governed by opportunity rather than by strict ecological analyses, primarily because distribution maps of species and habitats have been unavailable. Map-based assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of evolving MPA networks, such as the one presented here, are needed in adaptive management. They can provide an efficient tool for visualising and communicating the results to stakeholders and policy makers in the process of working towards ecological coherence.},

for understanding the spatial structure of populations and for
developing appropriate monitoring and management strategies. Here, we
used the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis as a model species to
investigate connectivity patterns within the Berlengas and Arrabida
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along the central Portuguese west coast.
We generated an atlas of location-specific environmental markers based
on the microchemistry of bivalve larval shells (using laser ablation
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). This atlas was then
employed to trace the natal origins of newly settled mussels and
generate connectivity matrices among populations. Our results reflected
3 distinctive chemical signatures in larval shells, corresponding to 3
regions: Estremadura, Cascais and Arrabida. Linear discriminant analyses
allowed for a high reclassification success (average of 79.5{\%} of
jackknifed cross-validated cases correctly assigned) based on 8 of the
16 trace elements analyzed (B, P, Co, Cu, Zn, Ce, Pb and U). The
population connectivity matrix identified different dispersal pathways
for mussel larvae, in particular a predominantly northward dispersion
pattern in July 2013. This pattern was consistent with simultaneous
environmental physical data, which confirmed an extended period of wind
reversal and upwelling relaxation. The Arrabida MPA was an important
source population for the other 2 regions and showed high rates of
self-recruitment but limited connectivity to the Berlengas MPA. These
direct measures of demographic connectivity can be a powerful tool to
inform policymakers on the conservation and management of ecologically

While recommendations exist for integrating connectivity data into MPA planning, little advice exists on how to assess the connectivity of existing networks. This study makes use of recently observed larval characteristics and freely available models to demonstrate how such an assessment could be undertaken. The cold water coral (CWC) Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) is used as a model species, as much of the NE Atlantic MPA network has been designated for CWC reef protection, but the ecological coherence of the network has yet to be assessed. Simulations are run for different behavioural null models allowing a comparison of âpassive' (current driven) and âactive' (currents + vertical migration) dispersal, while an average prediction is used for MPA assessment. This model suggests that the network may support widespread larval exchange and has good local retention rates but still has room for improvement. The best performing MPAs were large and central to the network facilitating transport across local dispersal barriers. On average, passive and active dispersal simulations gave statistically similar results, providing encouragement to future local dispersal assessments where active characteristics are unknown.},

abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered key elements to the achievement of conservation and sustainable marine management targets. Yet, even if recently the number of MPAs has increased rapidly worldwide, the area of ocean under some type of MPA classification is far behind the international targets (e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity) considered essential for conservation of the world's oceans. Furthermore, coherence, representativeness and effectiveness of existing MPAs are largely unknown or even weakly defined. In this study, general characteristics of MPAs from Portugal, Spain and France were collected and used to evaluate conservation progress in this geographic area. In addition, an online questionnaire was administered to the MPAs managers, and focused on multiple processes inherent to each MPA, namely on the characteristics and suitability of planning, management, monitoring, governance and enforcement. Obtained responses were used to calculate the overall level of MPA management effectiveness, and multivariate analyses were used to identify the factors that most contributed to differences in effectiveness. Most MPAs are adjacent to the coast, are small in area (near 50{\%} have less than 20Â km2) and were established with multiple goals concerning species conservation and sustainable development of economic activities (e.g. fisheries). Only 9{\%} of analysed MPAs are larger than 1000Â km2and are unequally distributed among the study area. Overall, 46{\%} of MPAs and 59{\%} of total area covered were established during the last five years, while only 3 of the 35 no-take areas (22{\%} in area) were implemented during this period. High MPA effectiveness (i.e. the extent to which an MPA is protecting values and achieving its goals and objectives) was related with high levels of stakeholders support, with suitable goals, management and enforcement. Results highlighted the need to improve MPA coverage taking into account other existing MPAs to increase coherence and representativeness of networks, that new no-take areas should be implemented in key conservation sites and that management strategies (e.g. enforcement and monitoring) should be strengthened. These findings are applicable to the study area yet methodology and outcomes are pertinent to MPA management worldwide. Ultimately, strategies aiming at maximizing MPA performance are probably as important as the increase of MPA coverage.},

abstract = {Creating representative networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) as part of an ecosystem-based management approach is generally advocated to protect the full spectrum of marine ecosystems and vulnerable species. Core objectives for designing MPA networks incorporate issues of scale, size and spacing. Ascertaining when such objectives have been met, and thus when a network can be judged to be ecologically coherent, presents an ongoing challenge. This paper presents a broad-scale approach to assess the degree of ecological coherence within one such network. In 2013 an independent ecological coherence assessment was requested by OSPAR, the Regional Seas Convention for the North-east Atlantic, of the ecological coherence of its regional MPA network. As is often the case in the marine environment, the data were not sufficiently comprehensive or spatially inclusive to allow for a thorough assessment for the entire region. Consequently two levels of testing were applied: (1) basic tests applied to the whole OSPAR maritime area; and (2) a more sophisticated second level of tests directed at specific OSPAR regions and subregions for which more complete datasets were available. The former considered major gaps based on basic distribution thresholds and representativity (both biogeographic and bathymetric). The latter focused on broad-scale habitat presence to determine replication, adequacy and connectivity. On the basis of these tests it was concluded that while the OSPAR MPA network as a whole is not ecologically coherent, nonetheless significant progress towards global targets, such as protection of 10{\%} of marine and coastal environments under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has been made. Gaps in the distribution of MPAs were identified, particularly under-representation of certain biogeographic provinces and bathymetric zones of depths greater than 75 m including bathyal (200â3000 m) and abyssal (3000â6000 m) depths. To address such gaps, a cooperative region by region approach will be required by the OSPAR Parties to identify where positioning new MPAs can enhance ecological coherence. A limitation of the 2013 assessment was that it did not consider which MPAs are designated and managed for the protection of specific features; rather, it assumed that all features that fall within an MPA are protected. With a redevelopment of the OSPAR MPA database underway it is hoped that reporting of such details by Parties will improve, allowing for more specificity in future analyses. However, as the first such assessment of its kind our two-level approach serves as a case study of a pragmatic example of how assessments of ecologically coherent networks might be undertaken using GIS to contribute to systematic conservation planning.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are powerful management tools used worldwide for conserving marine species and habitats. Yet, many MPAs fail to achieve their management objectives because of shortfalls in understanding the level of legitimacy stakeholders afford to an MPA. Legitimacy refers to the ability of a political action, in this case an MPA, to be perceived as right and just by the various people who are involved, interested, and/or affected by it. Using responses from key stakeholders and managers at two coastal MPAs in Atlantic Canada, this study examined the importance of various factors shaping perceptions of MPA effectiveness and the role of legitimacy in influencing those perceptions. Results indicate that most indicators of legitimacy are important to stakeholders for MPA effectiveness. Specifically, there was consensus across case studies on the importance of community leadership and the establishment of trust in determining the level of legitimacy afforded to MPAs. However key differences in perceptions were evident from stakeholders both between and within groups, and between stakeholders and MPA managers. A novel legitimacy framework and a stakeholder-vetted suite of indicators for legitimacy are presented and recommended for use by MPA managers in assessing the legitimacy of coastal MPAs, before, during and after MPA designation. The results provide an increased understanding of stakeholders' perceptions of legitimacy, giving managers key additional information needed to establish effective MPAs in the future.},

abstract = {The fishery for reef octopus Octopus cyanea is one of the three economically most important activities for coastal communities in the south-west region of Madagascar (Barnes-Mauthe et al. 2013), an arid region where there are few economic alternatives to marine resource extrac-tion. Since the early 2000s, fisheries collection companies have purchased catches from coastal villages throughout the region. This commercial exploitation of octopus has increased the local value of the fishery, and transformed a formerly traditional and subsistence fishery into an export-driven collection fishery, dramatically increasing rates of exploitation and raising concerns over sustainability (Langley 2006; L'Haridon 2006; Nadon et al. 2007). There is evidence of overfishing of a number of marine resources in the south-west (Laroche et al. 1997; Woods-Ballard et al. 2003; Iida 2005; McVean et al. 2005), and these documented declines highlight the need for initiatives to manage the octopus fishery in the region. Perry et al. (1999) identified three possible manage-ment approaches suitable for invertebrate fisheries: size/ sex limits, catch regulation and controls on the rate of exploitation. Management regimes for octopus fisheries elsewhere focus predominantly on gear management and minimum catch sizes (Oosthuizen 2003; Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Rueda and Garc{\'{i}}a-Fl{\'{o}}rez 2007; Kim et al. 2008). However, traditional and artisanal fisheries are generally difficult to manage, since methods and restrictions commonly used to promote sustainability of larger commercial fisheries are often not applicable, and data on which to base manage-ment interventions are commonly unavailable (Freire and Garcia-Allut 2000; Otero et al. 2005). Size limits for Madagascar's O. cyanea fishery were introduced in 2005 as Malagasy national law (Arr{\^{e}}t{\'{e}} no. 16 376/2005; MAEP 2005) but have proven difficult to implement because the methods employed by fishers are non-selective. Octopus are injured and often killed during forced removal from their dens, and there is therefore little point in discarding them if fishers subsequently realise they may be below the national minimum size limit of 350 g. Catch regulations, such as quotas, are also difficult to impose as there is little capacity within coastal communities of the region for enforcement of legislation (Harris 2011). Marine closures such as reserves or protected areas have been widely used to control the rate of fisheries exploit ation around the world, and have been shown to increase density and biomass of stocks (Pipitone et al. 2000; Roberts et al. 2001; Halpern and Warner 2002; Halpern 2003; Roberts et al. 2005; Navarte et al. 2006). However, permanent closures of important fishing sites are often hard to establish and enforce owing to the economic cost of lost catches and revenues by fishing communities with near total dependence on marine resource extraction This paper presents evidence of the fisheries effect of experimental temporary fishing closures for Octopus cyanea in the then-emergent Velondriake Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) in south-west Madagascar during 2004â2006. We present an analysis of the O. cyanea catch data for the first two years of temporary closures based on landings data collected from village-based octopus collectors. We found a significant closure effect in terms of total weight and number of octopus caught on opening days, but observed that these benefits dissipated quickly, returning to pre-closure levels within days. Mean octopus size increased by 41{\%} on average when compared to data from selected control sites. However, extremely high levels of fishing effort on opening days meant that these biological effects did not translate into increased weight of octopus caught per successful fisher over the opening tide. Upon opening of concurrent closures during the second round of closures we found significant increases in the weight of octopus caught per successful fisher. We conclude that the pilot closures had a significant closure effect, but caution against isolated openings leading to concentrated fishing effort on opening days.},

abstract = {Despite many biotic, physical, and political challenges for place-based conservation in open ocean environments, conservation of discrete oceanic regions by designating pelagic marine protected areas (PMPAs) has gained considerable traction. In the oligotrophic central Pacific, a patchy and dynamic ecosystem, a robust network of PMPAs has recently been established. However, evaluations of PMPA efficacy in providing appropriate habitat coverage for pelagic species are lacking, particularly in the tropics. Here, we used high resolution GPS tracking and home range analyses of tropical boobies to determine the distribution and foraging habitat use of three sympatric species (. Sula sula, Sula dactylatra, and Sula leucogaster) in two PMPAs that varied substantially in size and shape. At each site we characterized the extent and use of foraging habitat inside and outside the PMPA that surrounded each breeding colony. We found profound variation within and among species in foraging behavior and habitat use across the two sites; this was partially explained by variation in bathymetry. Yet, despite variation both in PMPA size and shape, and in foraging behavior of the birds, we determined that the PMPAs each encapsulated more than 85{\%} (. n=. 216 trips) of foraging habitat for each species, indicating that these PMPAs provided important habitat coverage for highly mobile tropical species. While this study highlights the challenges in effectively designing PMPAs even for relatively well-studied, central place foragers, given strong variation in foraging ecologies across sites, it also suggests that PMPAs do provide meaningful habitat coverage for at least some pelagic species.},

abstract = {Most animal species show detectable genetic differentiation between populations, but the extent and pattern of this differentiation varies considerably between species. Some show gradual differentiation due to isolation by distance, some show chaotic patchiness, and some show relative uniformity over large distances with striking discontinuities over short distances. These varying patterns reflect both the dispersal powers of the organism and its population history. The evolution of locally adapted genotypes is facilitated in populations with restricted gene flow, and such co-adapted genotypes may then vary from population to population depending on local selective forces. Restocking and stock enhancement programmes need to be aware of the stock structure of the target species, as the introduction of genotypes unrepresentative of the augmented population can have negative effects. Swamping the native population with large numbers of genotypes from a few matings, even if derived from the native population, can also be detrimental. It follows that, wherever possible, restocking and stock enhancement programmes should use broodstock taken directly from the population to be enhanced, and that large numbers of broodstock should be used. If broodstock cannot be taken from the population to be enhanced, they should be taken from the genetically most similar population available. Restocking and stock enhancement programmes should be genetically monitored to determine their impacts and outcomes. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, increasing number of international agreements have challenged traditional MPA design and management by calling for the implementation of large-scale marine protected areas (LSMPAs) within national jurisdictions and into the high seas. Since 2004, ten LSMPAs were established representing more than 80{\%} of the worldwide MPA coverage, most of them in the Pacific. Here we analysed the drivers behind the establishment of LSMPA. This recent phenomenon is mainly driven by political reasons due to international conservation targets and intense domestic and international advocacy. Although we still lack scientific studies showing the benefit or the effectiveness of large-scale conservation, scientists advocate protecting marine biodiversity in remote places as a precautionary approach. International conservation targets provided political motivation for LSMPA establishment enabling coastal states to benefit from several legal mechanisms to strengthen their sovereignties over sea spaces. The rise of LSMPAs boosted the awakening of indigenous communities at the international, national, cultural and political level. In some cases the conservation initiatives catalysed indigenous claims to preserve their traditional and future rights forcing States to make sovereignty compromises on traditional rights. Ultimately, LSMPAs raise many issues of enforcement, management costs and governance structure that may challenge their effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {* As systems of marine protected areas (MPAs) expand globally, there is a risk that new MPAs will be biased toward places that are remote or unpromising for extractive activities, and hence follow the trend of terrestrial protected areas in being âresidual' to commercial uses. Such locations typically provide little protection to the species and ecosystems that are most exposed to threatening processes. * There are strong political motivations to establish residual reserves that minimize costs and conflicts with users of natural resources. These motivations will likely remain in place as long as success continues to be measured in terms of area (km2) protected. * The global pattern of MPAs was reviewed and appears to be residual, supported by a rapid growth of large, remote MPAs. The extent to which MPAs in Australia are residual nationally and also regionally within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park was also examined. * Nationally, the recently announced Australian Commonwealth marine reserves were found to be strongly residual, making almost no difference to âbusiness as usual' for most ocean uses. Underlying this result was the imperative to minimize costs, but without the spatial constraints of explicit quantitative objectives for representing bioregions or the range of ecological features in highly protected zones. * In contrast, the 2004 rezoning of the GBR was exemplary, and the potential for residual protection was limited by applying a systematic set of planning principles, such as representing a minimum percentage of finely subdivided bioregions. Nonetheless, even at this scale, protection was uneven between bioregions. Within-bioregion heterogeneity might have led to no-take zones being established in areas unsuitable for trawling with a risk that species assemblages differ between areas protected and areas left available for trawling. * A simple four-step framework of questions for planners and policy makers is proposed to help reverse the emerging residual tendency of MPAs and maximize their effectiveness for conservation. This involves checks on the least-cost approach to establishing MPAs in order to avoid perverse outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {1. Climate and land-use changes will require species to move large distances following shifts in their suitable habitats, which will frequently involve traversing intensively human-modified landscapes. Practitioners will therefore need to evaluate and act to enhance the degree to which habitat patches scattered throughout the landscape may function as stepping stones facilitating dispersal among otherwise isolated habitat areas. 2. We formulate a new generalized network model of habitat connectivity that accounts for the number of dispersing individuals and for long-distance dispersal processes across genera- tions. By doing so, we bridge the gap between complex dynamic population models, which are generally too data demanding and hence difficult to apply in practical wide-scale decision- making, and simpler static connectivity models that only consider the amount of habitat that can be reached by a single average disperser during its life span. 3. We find that the loss of intermediate and sufficiently large stepping-stone habitat patches can cause a sharp decline in the distance that can be traversed by species (critical spatial thresholds) that cannot be effectively compensated by other factors previously regarded as crucial for long-distance dispersal (fat-tailed dispersal kernels, source popula- tion size). 4. We corroborate our findings by showing that our model largely outperforms previous con- nectivity models in explaining the large-scale range expansion of a forest bird species, the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, over a 20-year period. 5. The capacity of species to exploit the opportunities created by networks of stepping-stone patches largely depends on species-specific life-history traits, suggesting that species assem- blages traversing fragmented landscapes may be exposed to a spatial filtering process driving long-term changes in community composition. 6. Synthesis and applications. Previous static connectivity models seriously underestimate the importance of stepping-stone patches in sustaining rare but crucial dispersal events. We provide a conceptually broader model that shows that stepping stones (i) must be of sufficient size to be of conservation value, (ii) are particularly crucial for the spread of species (either native or inva- sive) or genotypes over long distances and (iii) can effectively reduce the isolation of the largest habitat blocks in reserves, therefore largely contributing to species persistence across wide spa- tial and temporal scales.

abstract = {Abstract: Fragmentation of animal and plant populations typically leads to genetic erosion and increased probability of extirpation. Although these effects can usually be reversed by re-establishing gene flow between population fragments, managers sometimes fail to do so due to fears of outbreeding depression (OD). Rapid development of OD is due primarily to adaptive differentiation from selection or fixation of chromosomal variants. Fixed chromosomal variants can be detected empirically. We used an extended form of the breeders' equation to predict the probability of OD due to adaptive differentiation between recently isolated population fragments as a function of intensity of selection, genetic diversity, effective population sizes, and generations of isolation. Empirical data indicated that populations in similar environments had not developed OD even after thousands of generations of isolation. To predict the probability of OD, we developed a decision tree that was based on the four variables from the breeders' equation, taxonomic status, and gene flow within the last 500 years. The predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations is elevated when the populations have at least one of the following characteristics: are distinct species, have fixed chromosomal differences, exchanged no genes in the last 500 years, or inhabit different environments. Conversely, the predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations of the same species is low for populations with the same karyotype, isolated for {\textless}500 years, and that occupy similar environments. In the former case, we recommend crossing be avoided or tried on a limited, experimental basis. In the latter case, crossing can be carried out with low probability of OD. We used crosses with known results to test the decision tree and found that it correctly identified cases where OD occurred. Current concerns about OD in recently fragmented populations are almost certainly excessive.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a debate over various methods that could objectively prioritize conservation value below the species level. Most prominent among these has been the evolutionarily significant unit (ESU). We reviewed ESU concepts with the aim of proposing a more unified concept that would reconcile opposing views. Like species concepts, conflicting ESU concepts are all essentially aiming to define the same thing: segments of species whose divergence can be measured or evaluated by putting differential emphasis on the role of evolutionary forces at varied temporal scales. Thus, differences between ESU concepts lie more in the criteria used to define the ESUs themselves rather than in their fundamental essence. We provide a context-based framework for delineating ESUs which circumvents much of this situation. Rather than embroil in a befuddled debate over an optimal criterion, the key to a solution is accepting that differing criteria will work more dynamically than others and can be used alone or in combination depending on the situation. These assertions constitute the impetus behind adaptive evolutionary conservation.},

abstract = {The setting of conservation priorities within species requires explicit goals and identification of the appropriate targets for conservation. I suggest that the conservation goal should be to conserve ecological and evolutionary processes; rather than to preserve specific phenotypic variants - the products of those processes. From this perspective, we should seek to conserve historically isolated, and thus independently evolving, sets of populations (i.e., Evolutionarily Significant Units, ESU). This can require manipulation of the component Management Units (MUs), some of which may be phenotypically distinct. Here I explore the application of this approach to the design of translocations for conservation management. A process-oriented approach suggests that individuals should not be translocated between ESUs, but under some circumstances it is appropriate to mix individuals from different MUs within an ESU. These circumstances include augmentation of remnant populations that are showing signs of inbreeding depression or increased fragmentation and the use of mixed stocks for reintroductions into modified or changing environments or for introductions into novel environments. These actions are consistent with the goal of maintaining processes, but the extent to which differences in adaptation or coadaptation constrain the viability of populations subject to translocation needs further exploration. Both theory and limited experimental evidence suggests that these constraints can be overcome if sufficient genetic variation is present and evolutionary processes can operate without substantially reducing population viability. One remaining question is the extent to which genetic coadaptation, and the resulting outbreeding depression, develops along environmental gradients and how this compares to the build-up of genetic incompatibility between historically isolated populations.},

The Bahamas is reported to hold the majority of fish spawning aggregations for Nassau grouper, however, the status and genetic population structure of fish within the country is largely unknown, presenting a major knowledge gap for their sustainable management. Between August 2014âFebruary 2017, 464 individual Nassau grouper sampled from The Bahamas were genotyped using 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci to establish measures of population structure, genetic diversity and effective population size (Ne). Nassau grouper were characterized by mostly high levels of genetic diversity, but we found no evidence for geographic population structure. Microsatellite analyses revealed weak, but significant genetic differentiation of Nassau grouper throughout the Bahamian archipelago (Global FST 0.00236, p = 0.0001). Temporal analyses of changes in Ne over the last 1,000 generations provide evidence in support of a pronounced historic decline in Bahamian Nassau grouper that appears to pre-date anthropogenic fishing activities. M-ratio results corroborate significant reductions in Ne throughout The Bahamas, with evidence for population bottlenecks in three islands and an active fish spawning aggregation along with apparent signs of inbreeding at two islands. Current estimates of Ne for Nassau grouper are considerably lower compared with historic levels. These findings represent important new contributions to our understanding of the evolutionary history, demographics and genetic connectivity of this endangered species, which are of critical importance for advancing their sustainable management.},

abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of currently available substrate data to designate marine reserves to meet conservation objectives. The case study site is Lyme Bay (approx. 2460km2), in the western English Channel. An area of 240km2in Lyme Bay was designated 'closed to bottom dredging' in July 2008 with the aim of protecting reefs which are an important habitat for Eunicella verrucosa (pink sea fan). The effects of using different substrate data resolution on the selection of sites to protect a range of biotopes using the Marxan package are determined. The effect of including a closed area on the efficiency of a marine reserve network is also investigated. Findings suggest that substrate data did not capture the biodiversity of the area and that using no data at all was equally effective. If low resolution data are all that are available then other options, such as expert opinion, or other data, such as activity use information could be used instead. Including a predefined closed area into the analysis led to an increase in area required to meet conservation goals using high resolution biotope data. It also increased the area of the reserve using the three substrate layers with no increase in protection for biotopes. This suggests that when designing networks of marine protected area sites, including current protected areas may be inefficient, resulting in larger areas being protected with no increased conservation of marine biodiversity. Policy makers must be prepared to adapt management in light of these findings and be aware of the shortcomings of the data available for use in marine conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

These data contain a wealth of information about the demographic history of the populations from which they originate. Many sophisticated statistical inference procedures have been developed to infer the demographic history of populations from this type of genomic data. In this review, we discuss the different statistical methods available for inference of demography, providing an overview of the underlying theory and logic behind each approach. We also discuss the types of data required and the pros and cons of each method. We then discuss how these methods have been applied to a variety of nonmodel organisms. We conclude by presenting some recommendations for researchers looking to use genomic data to infer demographic history.

abstract = {Long-standing concerns about the effects of scallop dredging and demersal trawling on high diversity mudstone reef and cobble habitats in Lyme Bay, southwest England, were addressed by the exclusion of bottom towed fishing gear from a 206km2area in July 2008. A consortium led by Plymouth University Marine Institute was funded by the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to design and implement a study (initially funded for 3 years) to examine the effects of the closure on both nekton and epibenthos. This paper provides a detailed account of the methodology employed from survey design to data analysis to provide a protocol for future MPA monitoring programmes. Information on historical fishing effort, substrate distributions and current and previous closure boundaries was overlaid using GIS to locate suitable monitoring sites. Non-destructive and cost-effective techniques, including a towed high-definition video array and static baited video, were used to quantify changes in relative abundances of epibenthos and nekton over three years at sites previously fished but now closed to bottom towed fishing compared to both fished and un-fished reference sites. The monitoring programme as described provides a model for robust, cost-effective evaluation of the efficacy of policy instruments for feedback into the adaptive management cycle. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {There has been remarkably little attention to using the high resolution provided by genotyping-by-sequencing (i.e., RADseq and similar methods) for assessing related- ness in wildlife populations. A major hurdle is the genotyping error, especially allelic dropout, often found in this type of data that could lead to downward-biased, yet precise, estimates of relatedness. Here, we assess the applicability of genotyping- by-sequencing for relatedness inferences given its relatively high genotyping error rate. Individuals of known relatedness were simulated under genotyping error, allelic dropout and missing data scenarios based on an empirical ddRAD data set, and their true relatedness was compared to that estimated by seven relatedness estimators. We found that an estimator chosen through such analyses can circumvent the influence of genotyping error, with the estimator of Ritland (Genetics Research, 67, 175) shown to be unaffected by allelic dropout and to be the most accurate when there is genotyping error. We also found that the choice of estimator should not rely solely on the strength of correlation between estimated and true relatedness as a strong correlation does not necessarily mean estimates are close to true relatedness. We also demonstrated how even a large SNP data set with genotyping error (allelic dropout or otherwise) or missing data still performs better than a perfectly genotyped microsatellite data set of tens of markers. The simulation-based approach used here can be easily implemented by others on their own genotyping-by-sequen- cing data sets to confirm the most appropriate and powerful estimator for their data.},

@article{Leis2006,
abstract = {A pelagic larval stage is found in nearly all demersal marine teleost fishes, and it is during this pelagic stage that the geographic scale of dispersal is determined. Marine biologists have long made a simplifying assumption that behaviour of larvae-with the possible exception of vertical distribution-has negligible influence on larval dispersal. Because advection by currents can take place over huge scales during a pelagic larval stage that typically lasts for several days to several weeks, this simplifying assumption leads to the conclusion that populations of marine demersal fishes operate over, and are connected over, similar huge scales. This conclusion has major implications for our perception of how marine fish populations operate and for our management of them. Recent (and some older) behavioural research-reviewed here-reveals that for a substantial portion of the pelagic larval stage of perciform fishes, the simplifying assumption is invalid. Near settlement, and for a considerable portion of the pelagic stage prior to that, larvae of many fish species are capable of swimming at speeds faster than mean ambient currents over long periods, travelling tens of kilometres. Only the smallest larvae of perciform fishes swim in an energetically costly viscous hydrodynamic environment (i.e., low Reynolds number). Vertical distribution is under strong behavioural control from the time of hatching, if not before, and can have a decisive, if indirect, influence on dispersal trajectories. Larvae of some species avoid currents by occupying the epibenthic boundary layer. Larvae are able to swim directionally in the pelagic environment, with some species apparently orientating relative to the sun and others to settlement sites. These abilities develop relatively early, and ontogenetic changes in orientation are seemingly common. Larvae of some species can use sound to navigate, and others can use odour to find settlement habitat, at least over small scales. Other senses may also be important to orientation. Larvae are highly aware of their environment and of potential predators, and some school during the pelagic larval stage. Larvae are selective about where they settle at both meso and micro scales, and settlement is strongly influenced by interactions with resident fishes. Most of these behaviours are flexible; for example, swimming speeds and depth may vary among locations, and speed may vary with swimming direction. In direct tests, these behaviours result in dispersal different from that predicted by currents alone. Work with both tropical and temperate species shows that these behaviours begin to be significant relatively early in larval development, but much more needs to be learned about the ontogeny of behaviour and sensory abilities in larvae of marine fishes. As a preliminary rule of thumb, behaviour must be taken into account in considerations of dispersal after the preflexion stage, and vertical distribution behaviour can influence dispersal from hatching. Larvae of perciform fishes are close to being planktonic at the start of the pelagic period and are clearly nektonic at its end, and for a substantial period prior to that. All these things differ among species. Larvae of clupeiform, gadiform and pleuronectiform fishes may be less capable behaviourally than perciform fishes, but this remains to be confirmed. Clearly, these behaviours, along with hydrography, must be included in modelling dispersal and retention and may provide explanations for recent demonstrations of self-recruitment in marine fish populations. Current work is directed at understanding the ontogeny of the gradual transition from planktonic to nektonic behaviour. Although it is clear that larvae of perciform fishes have the ability to strongly influence their dispersal trajectories, it is less clear whether or how these abilities are applied. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Marine species generally have large population sizes, continuous distributions and high dispersal capacity. Despite this, they are often subdivided into separate populations, which are the basic units of fisheries management. For example, populations of some fisheries species across the deep water of the Timor Trench are genetically different, inferring minimal movement and interbreeding. When connectivity is higher than the Timor Trench example, but not so high that the populations become one, connectivity between populations is crinkled. Crinkled connectivity occurs when migration is above the threshold required to link populations genetically, but below the threshold for demographic links. In future, genetic estimates of connectivity over crinkled links could be uniquely combined with other data, such as estimates of population size and tagging and tracking data, to quantify demographic connectedness between these types of populations. Elasmobranch species may be ideal targets for this research because connectivity between populations is more likely to be crinkled than for finfish species. Fisheries stock-assessment models could be strengthened with estimates of connectivity to improve the strategic and sustainable harvesting of biological resources.},

abstract = {Migrating and pre-migrating western rock lobster Panulirus cygnus were tagged with data-storage tags that recorded temperature and pressure, which was converted to depth (Pressure (kPa) surface pressure (kPa)/10)) at Dongara and Jurien Bay in Western Australia between December 2005 and December 2007. All lobsters were fitted with tag flotation devices, and returns were made by either commercial fishers or beachcombers who located detached tags. A total of 135 lobsters were released with "backpack" flotation tags, but only 84 (62.2{\%}) of the backpacks carried data-storage tags. Depths of release ranged from 5 to 113 m. Of the tagged lobsters released, commercial fishers recaptured 52 (38.5{\%}), whereas 11 tags (8.1{\%}) were found by beachcombers. At least 33{\%}, and possibly up to 63{\%}, of animals identified by their pale coloration as pre-migrating individuals, failed to migrate. Those that did migrate (n = 11) were at liberty from I to 94 days and showed generally similar movement patterns in that they migrated only at night from darkness (after 2000 h) until after moonrise. However, their movement patterns were less constrained by the rising of the moon in deep water. Only 27{\%} migrated nightly, compared with 73{\%} that skipped migrating on one or more nights, to restart some days later. This latter proportion would likely have been considerably greater, but some migrating animals were only at large for short periods before recapture, and therefore had little time to show any variation to the nocturnal migration pattern. Individual speeds of migration during periods of activity were estimated for nine lobsters as 0.20 to 0.68 km h(-1), with a mean speed of 0.44 kin h(-1), or 7.4 in min(-1). Improved knowledge of daily movement patterns resulting from this study provides a potentially important input into technological improvements in bait and pot design.},

We examined 1537 papers in greater detail in a systematic review. Superior competitive abilities of invaders, environmental disturbance, and invaded community species richness were the most common hypotheses examined. Most studies examined only a single hypothesis. Almost half of the papers were field observational studies. Studies of terrestrial invasions dominate the literature, with most of these concerning plant invasions.

abstract = {$\backslash$nPresent genetic patterns of marine organisms not only result from historical and contemporary ecological factors, but also from anthropogenic activities. Disentangling the relative effects of these factors can provide valuable insights into management and protection of exploitable species. The commercially important marine clam Tegillarca granosa is representative of species that are translocated within East Asia for coastal aquaculture purposes. We conducted a nucleotide sequence analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 markers in T. granosa to investigate its genetic diversity and distribution in 2 marginal seas (the East and South China Seas) of the northwestern Pacific. Based on phylogenetic inferences, we identified 2 evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) with high genetic distance between them for both markers. The high genetic distance may be associated with the historical isolation of the marginal seas during low sea level periods. One ESU was widely distributed in both seas, whereas the other was restricted to 2 disjunct localities in the South China Sea. Based on the isolation by distance analysis (p = 0.068) and comparison of patterns of co-occurring species, this pattern appears to be mostly attributable to the human-mediated translocations among coastal waters rather than natural range expansion. Furthermore, from a conservation viewpoint, the southern ESU is now facing high extinction risk because of mitochondrial introgression and smaller, fragmented populations; consequently, immediate proper management is required to protect the endangered populations representing this lineage. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.$\backslash$n Source: geobase},

Here, we provide first information about lobster distribution inside the German Bight off Helgoland. Diving in situ observations revealed that lobsters inhabit at least 15.6{\%} of all 64 investigated wrecks. Considering the difficulties of detecting lobsters at wrecks, the true percentage is most likely much higher. Their locations are spatially homogenously distributed throughout the inspected area. The study indicates a broad distribution of the European lobster over the German Bight. The habitats provided by a considerable fraction of the more than one thousand wrecks outside the Wadden Sea are potential lobster refuges within the mud and sand dominated sea floor.

abstract = {The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing âocean sprawlâ. Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.},

The replace-ment of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native spe-cies at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environmentâthe process by which species invasions and extinc-tions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promot-ing more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner. The challenge now is to manage ocean sprawl with the dual goal of supporting human populations and activities, simultaneously strengthening ecosystem resilience using an ecosystem-based approach. 194 LOUISE B.

abstract = {Summary: Offshore renewable energy provides an increasing component of our electricity supply. We have limited understanding of the potential environmental impacts of these developments, particularly in the move to larger scales. Surfaces provided by devices offer novel habitat to marine organisms, which may allow species to spread to new areas. We used coupled biological and hydrodynamic models to investigate the spread of intertidal marine organisms with pelagic larvae (such as barnacles or gastropods) in the region around south-western Scotland. We assessed the impact of novel habitat on dispersal and its role in allowing transgression of physical barriers. Model renewable energy device sites provided habitat for pelagic larval particles that would otherwise have been lost offshore. They also provided a source of larvae for existing coastal sites. Many offshore devices fulfilled source and destination (or intermediate connection) roles, creating new dispersal pathways, and allowing previously impossible northward dispersal from the Northern Irish coast to Scotland. Synthesis and applications. New habitat close to biogeographical barriers has implications for existing species' distributions and genetic population structure. It also affects the spread of non-native species and 'climate migrants'. Monitoring these sites for the presence of such species will be important in determining the future ecology of coastal habitat and in maintaining economic aquaculture and marina operations. Future model studies should focus on particular species of importance, taking account of their biology and current distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Abstract By providing new approaches to the investigation of demographic and evolutionary dynamics of wild populations, molecular genetics has led to fundamental changes in our understanding of marine ecology. In particular, genetic approaches have revolutionized our understanding in three areas: (i) most importantly, they have contributed to the discovery of extensive genetic population structure in many marine species, overturning the notion of large, essentially homogenous marine populations limiting local adaptation and speciation. (ii) Concomitant differences in ecologically important traits now indicate extensive adaptive differentiation and biocomplexity, potentially increasing the resilience to exploitation and disturbance. Evidence for rapid adaptive change in many populations underlies recent concerns about fisheries-induced evolution affecting life-history traits. (iii) A compilation of recent published research shows estimated effective population sizes that are 2â6 orders of magnitude smaller than census sizes, suggesting more complex recruitment dynamics in marine species than previously assumed. Studies on Atlantic cod are used to illustrate these paradigm shifts. In our synthesis, we emphasize the implications of these discoveries for marine ecology and evolution as well as the management and conservation of exploited marine fish populations. An important implication of genetic structuring and the potential for adaptive divergence is that locally adapted populations are unlikely to be replaced through immigration, with potentially detrimental consequences for the resilience to environmental change â a key consideration for sustainable fisheries management.},

abstract = {1. It has been suggested that the habitats which a species occupies can be divided into sources and sinks, depending on whether or not local reproduction is sufficient t8 balance mortality. Source populations are those where reproduction exceeds mortality, surplus individuals dispersing to sink populations where mortality exceeds local reproduction. Sink populations would not be viable in the absence of immigration. 2. A difference equation model is constructed to show that sources and sinks cannot be identified from a simple comparison of the demographic rates between populations, as measured by the numbers of births and deaths. 3. Viable populations may appear to be non-viable simply because the dispersal of individuals into them depresses fecundity or increases mortality as a result of densitydependence. The consequence is that local recruitment appears insufficient to balance local mortality. 4. Viable populations that appear as sinks, as a result of the dispersal of individuals into them, are termed here as 'pseudo-sinks'. They will clearly be difficult to distinguish from genuine sinks on the basis of a simple comparison of the numbers of births and deaths in different populations. 5. Examples of source and genuine sink populations and the data required to establish them are discussed},

Conservation biologists and resource managers need to know the structure of these populations in order to implement effective management policies, for example, to prioritize protection status or to determine translocation options. The geneticist's toolbox contains two broad families of measures that quan-tify population structureâfixation measures like F ST , G ST , and $\theta$, and al-lelic differentiation measures, like Jost's D and entropy differentiation. In the literature, there has been much discussion of the purpose, application, and performance of these two families of metrics (Gerlach, | Emily Latch 6 This , which , distribution , provided the original work is properly cited . {\textcopyright} .

Abstract We compare the two main classes of measures of population structure in genetics : (i) fixation measures such as F ST , G ST , and $\theta$ and (ii) allelic differentiation measures such as Jost ' s D and entropy differentiation . These two groups of measures quantify comple - mentary aspects of population structure , which have no necessary relationship with each other . We focus especially on empirical aspects of population structure relevant to conservation analyses . At the empirical level , the first set of measures quantify nearness to fixation , while the second set of measures quantify relative degree of al - lelic differentiation . The two sets of measures do not compete with each other . Fixation measures are often misinterpreted as measures of allelic differentiation in conservation applications ; we give examples and theoretical explanations showing why this interpretation can mislead . This misinterpretation has led to the mistaken belief that the absolute number of migrants determines allelic differentiation between demes when mutation rate is low ; we show that in the finite island model , the absolute number of migrants determines nearness to fixation , not allelic differentiation . We show that a different quantity , the factor that controls Jost ' s D , is a good predictor of the evolution of the actual genetic divergence between demes at equilibrium in this model . We also show that when conservation decisions require judgments about dif - ferences in genetic composition between demes , allelic differentiation measures should be used instead of fixation measures . Allelic differentiation of fast - mutating markers can be used to rank pairs or sets of demes according to their differentiation , but the allelic differentiation at coding loci of interest should be directly measured in order to judge its actual magnitude at these loci .},

abstract = {The interaction of local populations has been the focus of an increasing number of studies in the past 30 years. The study of source-sink dynamics has especially generated much interest. Many of the criteria used to distinguish sources and sinks incorporate the process of apparent survival (i.e., the combined probability of true survival and site fidelity) but not emigration. These criteria implicitly treat emigration as mortality, thus biasing the classification of sources and sinks in a manner that could lead to flawed habitat management. Some of the same criteria require rather restrictive assumptions about population equilibrium that, when violated, can also generate misleading inference. Here, we expand on a criterion (denoted "contribution" or Cr) that incorporates successful emigration in differentiating sources and sinks and that makes no restrictive assumptions about dispersal or equilibrium processes in populations of interest. The metric Cr is rooted in the theory of matrix population models, yet it also contains clearly specified parameters that have been estimated in previous empirical research. We suggest that estimates of emigration are important for delineating sources and sinks and, more generally, for evaluating how local populations interact to generate overall system dynamics. This suggestion has direct implications for issues such as species conservation and habitat management.},

abstract = {Fish population dynamics are affected by multiple ecosystem drivers, such as food-web interactions, exploitation, density-dependence and the wider environment. While tactical management is still dominated by single-species models that do not explicitly account for these drivers, more holistic ecosystem models are used in strategic management. One way forward in this regard is with individual-based models (IBMs), which provide a single framework in which these drivers can be represented explicitly. We present a generic marine fish IBM that incorporates spatial and temporal variation in food availability, temperature and exploitation. Key features of the model are that it (1) includes realistic energy budgets; (2) includes the full life cycle of fish; (3) is spatially-explicit and (4) incorporates satellite remote-sensing data to represent the environmental drivers. The rates at which individuals acquire and use energy depend on local food availability and temperature. Their state variables, including life stage, size and energy reserves, are updated daily, from which population structure and dynamics emerge. To demonstrate the use of the model we calibrate it for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the North East Atlantic. Most parameters are taken from the literature, except the background early mortality rate and the strength predator density dependence, which were estimated by fitting the model to data using Approximate Bayesian Computation. The calibrated model successfully matches the available data on mackerel population dynamics and structure. We demonstrate the use of the model for management purposes by simulating the population effects of opening and closing a sector of the North Sea to mackerel fishing. Our model uses basic principles of behavioural and physiological ecology to establish how spatial and temporal variations in ecosystem drivers affect the individuals in the population. Population dynamics and structure are calculated from the collective effects on individuals. Application to a test case shows the method can fit available data well. Individual-based approaches such as this study have potential for use in strategic management because they can account for spatial structuring, food-web interactions, density dependence, and environmental drivers within a single framework.},

abstract = {In the present work we used a particle-tracking model coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic model to study the combined effect of hydrodynamic variability and active vertical movements on the transport of sole larvae in the southern North Sea. Larval transport from the 6 main spawning grounds was simulated during 40 day periods starting on 2 plausible spawning dates, the 15/04 and the 01/05, during 2 years, 1995 and 1996. In addition to a "passive" behaviour, 3 types of active vertical movements inspired from previous studies have been tested: (1) Eggs and early larvae float in the surface waters, late larvae migrate toward the bottom and stay there until the end of the simulation; (2 and 3) Eggs float in the surface waters, early larvae perform diel vertical migrations in the surface waters, and (2) Late larvae perform diel vertical migrations in the bottom waters until the end of the simulation; or (3) Late larvae perform tidally synchronised vertical migrations in the bottom waters until the end of the simulation. These behaviours have been implemented in the model with vertical migration rates, positive or negative, which can account for buoyancy or real swimming activity. Variations in larval transport were analysed in terms of mean trajectories, final larvae distribution, larval retention above nurseries, and connectivity. Results suggest that the variations in larval retention above nurseries due to the varying hydrodynamic conditions are not consistent in space i.e. not the same for all the spawning sites. The effect of active vertical movements on larval transport is also not consistent in space: Effects of active vertical movements include decreased retention above nurseries, decreased transport and/or decreased horizontal dispersion of larvae through reduced vertical shear (depending on the zone). The variability in larval retention due to hydrodynamic variability is higher than variability due to differences in the behaviour of larvae. In terms of connectivity, exchanges of larvae between the 6 areas considered are moderate: 10 connections happened out of the 30 possible, and the amount of larvae exchanged is much lower than the amount of larvae retained except in a few cases. This is not incompatible with the possible existence of subpopulations of sole in the Eastern Channel and southern North Sea. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Climate may act on the dispersal and connectivity of marine populations through changes in the oceanic circulation and temperature, and by modifying species' prey and predator distributions. As dispersal and connectivity remain difficult to assess in situ, a first step in studying the effects of climate change can be achieved using biophysical models. To date, only a few biophysical models have been used for this purpose. Here we review these studies and also include results from other recent modelling efforts. We show that increased sea temperature, a major change expected under climate warming, may impact dispersal and connectivity patterns via changes in reproductive phenology (e.g., shift in the spawning season), transport (e.g., reduced pelagic larval duration under faster development rates), mortality (e.g., changes in the exposure to lethal temperatures), and behaviour (e.g., increased larval swimming speed). Projected changes in circulation are also shown to have large effects on the simulated dispersal and connectivity patterns. Although these biophysical modelling studies are useful preliminary approaches to project the potential effects of climate change, we highlight their current limitations and discuss the way forward, in particular the need for adequate coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical simulations using atmospheric forcing from realistic climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We developed a bioinformatic pipeline for identifying SNP panels that are informative for parentage analysis from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) data. This pipeline includes options for analysis with or without a reference genome, and provides methods to maximize genotyping accuracy and select sets of unlinked loci that have high statistical power. We test this pipeline on small populations of Mexican gray wolf and bighorn sheep, for which parentage analyses are expected to be challenging due to low genetic diversity and the presence of many closely related individuals. We compare the results of parentage analysis across SNP panels generated with or without the use of a reference genome, and between SNPs and microsatellites. For Mexican gray wolf, we conducted parentage analyses for 30 pups from a single cohort where samples were available from 64{\%} of possible mothers and 53{\%} of possible fathers, and the accuracy of parentage assignments could be estimated because true identities of parents were known a priori based on field data. For bighorn sheep, we conducted maternity analyses for 39 lambs from five cohorts where 77{\%} of possible mothers were sampled, but true identities of parents were unknown. Analyses with and without a reference genome produced SNP panels with â¥95{\%} parentage assignment accuracy for Mexican gray wolf, out-performing microsatellites at 78{\%} accuracy. Maternity assignments were completely consistent across all SNP panels for the bighorn sheep, and were 74.4{\%} consistent with assignments from microsatellites. Accuracy and consistency of parentage analysis were not reduced when using as few as 284 SNPs for Mexican gray wolf and 142 SNPs for bighorn sheep, indicating our pipeline can be used to develop SNP genotyping assays for parentage analysis with relatively small numbers of loci.},

Despite the frequent use of OA and EAA approaches and their increasing attractiveness for detecting signatures of selection, their application to field-based empirical data have not been synthesized. Here, we review 66 empirical studies that use Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in OA and EAA. We report trends and biases across biological systems, sequencing methods, approaches, parameters, environmental variables and their influence on detecting signatures of selection. We found striking variability in both the use and reporting of environmental data and statistical parameters. For example, linkage disequilibrium among SNPs and numbers of unique SNP associations identified with EAA were rarely reported. The proportion of putatively adaptive SNPs detected varied widely among studies, and decreased with the number of SNPs analyzed. We found that genomic sampling effort had a greater impact than biological sampling effort on the proportion of identified SNPs under selection. OA identified a higher proportion of outliers when more individuals were sampled, but this was not the case for EAA. To facilitate repeatability, interpretation and synthesis of studies detecting selection, we recommend that future studies consistently report geographic coordinates, environmental data, model parameters, linkage disequilibrium, and measures of genetic structure. Identifying standards for how OA and EAA studies are designed and reported will aid future transparency and comparability of SNP-based selection studies and help to progress landscape and evolutionary genomics.},

abstract = {Genetic rescue has now been attempted in several threatened species, but the contribution of genetics per se to any increase in population health can be hard to identify. Rescue is expected to be particularly useful when individuals are introduced into small isolated populations with low levels of genetic variation. Here we consider such a situation by documenting genetic rescue in the mountain pygmy possum, Burramys parvus. Rapid population recovery occurred in the target population after the introduction of a small number of males from a large genetically diverged population. Initial hybrid fitness was more than two-fold higher than non-hybrids; hybrid animals had a larger body size, and female hybrids produced more pouch young and lived longer. Genetic rescue likely contributed to the largest population size ever being recorded at this site. These data point to genetic rescue as being a potentially useful option for the recovery of small threatened populations. Genetic rescue can be valuable for the conservation of small populations threatened by low genetic diversity, but it carries the perceived risk of outbreeding depression. Here, Weeks et al. report increased hybrid fitness in a rescued population of the mountain pygmy possum, which likely contributed to population growth following genetic rescue.},

abstract = {Genetic clustering algorithms, implemented in programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE, have been used extensively in the characterisation of individuals and populations based on genetic data. A successful example is the reconstruction of the genetic history of African Americans as a product of recent admixture between highly differentiated populations. Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups that do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach, badMIXTURE, to assess the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry âpalettesâ estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated data and real case studies. Combining these complementary analyses with additional methods that are designed to test specific hypotheses allows a richer and more robust analysis of recent demographic history.},

Moreover, monitoring also provides context to marine science and over the last century has allowed development of a critical scientific understanding of the marine environment and the impacts that humans are having on it. The seas around the UK are currently monitored by targeted, impact-driven, programmes (e.g., fishery or pollution based monitoring) often using traditional techniques, many of which have not changed significantly since the early 1900s. The advent of a new wave of automated technology, in combination with changing political and economic circumstances, means that there is currently a strong drive to move toward a more refined, efficient, and effective way of monitoring. We describe the policy and scientific rationale for monitoring our seas, alongside a comprehensive description of the types of equipment and methodology currently used and the technologies that are likely to be used in the future. We contextualize the way new technologies and methodologies may impact monitoring and discuss how whole ecosystems models can give an integrated, comprehensive approach to impact assessment. Furthermore, we discuss how an understanding of the value of each data point is crucial to assess the true costs and benefits to society of a marine monitoring programme.},

abstract = {In July 2015, Scotland became one of the first countries to sign up to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which, unlike their forerunner the Millennium Development Goals, are not restricted to developing nations. Their respective targets should drive policy decisions for Scottish fisheries, in keeping with the universal intent of the new goals. This paper explores the relevance of SDG 14 to the Scottish fishing industry, noting that there are a number of linkages with other goals and targets that should be considered within management frameworks. Scottish fishing has a long history, but the size of the inshore fleet has seen decline in recent decades, particularly of small-scale fishers in rural communities. Available literature was reviewed and a survey of active Scottish fishers conducted to explore the current availability and equality of distribution of benefits from ecosystem services to Scottish fisheries, and the factors that affect them. The findings suggest that benefits may not currently be equally distributed across Scottish fisheries; this is largely sector dependent and driven by market forces, but also relates to gaps in current management and monitoring systems. Furthermore, the potential benefits to fisheries of marine protected areas (MPAs) established for conservation purposes are not adequately assessed as part of their design, which may result in less support from fisheries stakeholders and reduce the benefit to ecosystem services. It concludes with some recommendations for consideration by decision-makers to improve how fishing businesses and communities could benefit more from ecosystem services whilst operating within environmental limits.},

Public awareness of marine environmental threats and conservation efforts was assessed through comparison with the, assumed well informed, professional sample. Findings suggest that the public are generally well informed of threats to the marine environment, but are significantly less well informed about marine conservation and management strategies. Furthermore, despite indicating concern for the marine environment, members of the public display significantly fewer pro-environmental behaviours than marine conservation professionals. Public knowledge (and action) gaps are discussed as well as how these may be minimised, including a more interdisciplinary and active approach to science communication and public engagement.},

abstract = {Jamaica is one of the few remaining countries in the Caribbean region with an abundant population of Lobatus gigas (queen conch) able to sustain a lucrative fishery. Efforts to understand and maintain queen conch populations must involve an investigation into genetic connectivity. This connectivity facilitates population replenishment and continuity via the transport of veliger larvae by ocean currents. Due to the lack of knowledge in this regard to queen conch populations in Jamaica, the fine-scale population structure of Lobatus gigas populations in the country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) has been analysed by comparing the allele frequencies of nine microsatellite loci on a total of 459 individuals collected across twelve sites encompassing nearshore and offshore locations. Samples were grouped into five broad scale geographic clusters for statistical analysis. Our findings indicate that a weak but significant population structure exists (Global Fst = 0.004, p = 0.01) suggesting that mainland Jamaica acts as a weak divide between populations north and south of the island. Greater levels of connectivity are suggested between north coast populations and those present at the Formigas Bank, an offshore site northeast of the island. The island's primary conch fishing ground located offshore on Pedro Bank, receives limited gene flow from the other sampled populations and may be heavily dependent on local recruitment or receive recruits from sources external to Jamaica's EEZ. An analysis of surface ocean currents strongly supports these three findings and further that conch populations on Pedro Bank very likely receive recruits from sources distinct to those that supply nearshore populations. Further genetic studies into the recruitment patterns and sources for the community on Pedro Bank are therefore critical to ensure sustainable management of this commercially threatened population. Decades of intense fishing pressure has resulted in the establishment of the Allee effect on the island shelf, significantly hampering reproduction and consequently recruitment. If the question of recruitment on Pedro Bank is not addressed, further development of the Allee effect there and eventual population exhaustion are inevitable. These findings, their implications and recommendations for the management of the queen conch fishery in Jamaica are discussed.},

Although LSMPAs have received support among scientists and conservation bodies for wilderness protection, regional ecological connectivity, and improving resilience to climate change, there are also concerns. We identified 10 common criticisms of LSMPAs along three themes: (1) placement, governance, and management; (2) political expediency; and (3) socialâecological value and cost. Through critical evaluation of scientific evidence, we discuss the value, achievements, challenges, and potential of LSMPAs in these arenas. We conclude that although some criticisms are valid and need addressing, none pertain exclusively to LSMPAs, and many involve challenges ubiquitous in management. We argue that LSMPAs are an important component of a diversified management portfolio that tempers potential losses, hedges against uncertainty, and enhances the probability of achieving sustainably managed oceans.},

Reintroduction of Coho salmon to the interior Columbia River (Wenatchee River) using lower river stocks placed selective pressures on the new colonizers due to substantial differences with their original habi-tat such as migration distance and navigation of six additional hydropower dams. We used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to genotype 5,392 SNPs in reintroduced Coho salmon in the Wenatchee River over four generations to test for signals of temporal structure and adaptive variation. Temporal genetic structure among the three broodlines of reintroduced fish was evident among the initial return years (2000, 2001, and 2002) and their descendants, which indicated levels of repro-ductive isolation among broodlines. Signals of adaptive variation were detected from multiple outlier tests and identified candidate genes for further study. This study il-lustrated that genetic variation and structure of reintroduced populations are likely to reflect source stocks for multiple generations but may shift over time once established in nature.},

@article{LeLuyer2017a,
abstract = {A puzzling question in conservation biology is how to maintain overall fitness of individuals bred in captive environment upon release into the wild, especially for rehabilitating declining or threatened species. For salmonid species, a heritable change in fitness related traits and gene expression has been reported to occur in a single generation of captivity in hatchery environment. Such rapid changes are congruent with models of inadvertent domestication selection which may lead to maladaptation in the natural environment. Arguably, the underlying mechanism by which captivity may induce fitness difference between wild and captive congeners is still poorly understood. Short-term selection on complex phenotypic traits is expected to induce subtle changes in allele frequency over multiple loci. Yet, most studies investigating the molecular basis for rapid change in fitness related traits occurring in hatchery have concentrated their effort on finding evidence for selection at the genome level by identifying loci with large effect. Numerous wild stocks of Pacific anadromous salmon and trout (genus Oncorhynchus and Salmo) have experienced fluctuating abundance over the past century, with a series of sharp declines. With the objectives of preserving ecosystem integrity, enhancing declining populations and sustaining fisheries, conservation hatcheries have been flourishing. This is particularly true along the North American Pacific coast where billions of salmonids, all species included, are released each year. Despite substantial improvement of production management, the beneficial ecological role of hatcheries in enhancing and restoring wild stocks is still debated, mainly because of the reduced fitness and maladaptation of hatchery-fish when released in the wild. Although previous studies showed that domestication selection was involved in such fitness impairment, they also observed that different environmental conditions (e.g. reduced fish density) significantly modulated the physiological acclimation to hatchery environment. Environmental stimuli are especially relevant during early embryonic development, which also correspond to a sensitive methylation reprogramming window in vertebrates. It is therefore plausible that differences in rearing environment during early development may result in epigenetic modifications that could in turn impact on fitness. However, the only epigenetic study to date pertaining to captive rearing in salmonids and performed using methylation-sensitive amplified fragments (MSAP) failed to identify significant changes in methylation profile associated with hatchery rearing. Here, we used a higher resolution approach to compare the genome-wide pattern of methylation in hatchery-reared juvenile (smolt) Coho Salmon with that of their wild counterparts in two geographically distant rivers in British Columbia, Canada. Using a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) approach covering an average per individual of about 70 million cytosines in CpG context, we identified 100 methylated regions (DMRs) that differed in parallel between hatchery and natural origin salmon in both rivers. The total variance of epigenetic variation among individuals explained by river or origin and rearing environment in a RDA model was 16{\%} (adj.R2=0.16), and both variables equally explained about 8{\%} of the variance after controlling for each other. The gene ontology analysis revealed that regions with different methylation levels between hatchery and natural origin salmon showed enrichment for ion homeostasis, synaptic and neuromuscular regulation, immune and stress response, and control of locomotion functions. We further identified 15,044 SNPs that allowed detection of significant differences between either rivers or sexes. However, no effect of rearing environment was observed, confirming that hatchery and natural origin fish of a given river belong to the same panmictic population, as expected based on the hatchery programs applied in these rivers (see Supplementary experimental procedures). Moreover, neither a standard genome-scan approach nor a polygenic statistical framework allowed detection of selective effects within a single generation between hatchery and natural origin salmon. Therefore, this is the first study to demonstrate that parallel epigenetic modifications induced by hatchery rearing during early development may represent a potential explanatory mechanism for rapid change in fitness-related traits previously reported in salmonids.},

abstract = {Highâthroughput sequencing is a powerful tool, but suffers biases and errors that must be accounted for to prevent false biological conclusions. Such errors include batch effects, technical errors only present in subsets of data due to procedural changes within a study. If overlooked and multiple batches of data are combined, spurious biological signals can arise, particularly if batches of data are correlated with biological variables. Batch effects can be minimized through randomisation of sample groups across batches. However, in longâterm or multiâyear studies where data are added incrementally, full randomisation is impossible and batch effects may be a common feature.

Here we present a case study where false signals of selection were detected due to a batch effect in a multiâyear study of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). The batch effect arose because

sequencing read length changed over the course of the project and populations were added incrementally to the study, resulting in nonârandom distributions of populations across read lengths. The differences in read length caused small misalignments in a subset of the data, leading to false variant alleles and thus false SNPs. Pronounced allele frequency differences between populations arose at these SNPs because of the correlation between read length and population. This created highly statistically significant, but biologically spurious, signals of selection and false associations between allele frequencies and the environment. We highlight the risk of batch effects and discuss strategies to reduce the impacts of batch effects in multiâyear highâthroughput sequencing studies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Threatened Caribbean coral communities can benefit from high-resolution genetic data used to inform management and conservation action. We use Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) to investigate genetic patterns in the threatened coral, Acropora cervicornis, across the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) and the western Caribbean. Results show extensive population structure at regional scales and resolve previously unknown structure within the FRT. Different regions also exhibit up to threefold differences in genetic diversity (He), suggesting targeted management based on the goals and resources of each population is needed. Patterns of genetic diversity have a strong spatial component, and our results show Broward and the Lower Keys are among the most diverse populations in Florida. The genetic diversity of Caribbean staghorn coral is concentrated within populations and within individual reefs (AMOVA), highlighting the complex mosaic of population structure. This variance structure is similar over regional and local scales, which suggests that in situ nurseries are adequately capturing natural patterns of diversity, representing a resource that can replicate the average diversity of wild assemblages, serving to increase intraspecific diversity and potentially leading to improved biodiversity and ecosystem function. Results presented here can be translated into specific goals for the recovery of A. cervicornis, including active focus on low diversity areas, protection of high diversity and connectivity, and practical thresholds for responsible restoration.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd Understanding the spatial scale of demographic connectivity in marine reef fishes dispersing pelagic larvae is a challenging task because of the technical difficulties associated with tagging and monitoring the movements of progeny at early life stages. Several studies highlighted a strong importance of local retention with levels of dispersal of ecological significance restricted to short distances. To date little information is available in species where pelagic dispersal lasts for long periods of time. In this work, population structure and connectivity were studied in the grey triggerfish, Balistes capriscus. Grey triggerfish larvae and juveniles remain associated with floating Sargassum sp. beds for an estimated period of 4â7 months before settling on benthic habitats where they remain sedentary as adults. Analysis of genetic variation among populations along the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico and U.S. east coast, encompassing over 3,100 km of coastline, revealed homogeneous allele frequencies and a weak isolation-by-distance pattern. Moment and maximum-likelihood estimates of dispersal parameters both indicated occurrence of large neighbourhoods with estimates of the dispersal distribution parameter $\sigma$ of 914 and 780 km, respectively. Simulated distributions of dispersal distances using several distribution functions all featured substantial fractions of long-distance dispersal events with the 90{\%} percentiles of travel distance prior to settlement averaging 1,809 km. These results suggest a high dependency of local recruitment on the output of nonlocal spawning stocks located hundreds of kilometres away and a reduced role of local retention in this species.},

We apply a variety of McDonaldâKreitman style methods to the data. We find that the evolution of mitochondrial DNA is dominated by slightly deleterious mutations, a finding which is supported by a number of previous studies. However, when we control for the presence of deleterious mutations using a new method, we find that mitochondria undergo a significant amount of adaptive evolution, with an estimated 26{\%} (95{\%} confidence intervals: 5.7â45{\%}) of nonsynonymous substitutions fixed by adaptive evolution. We further find some weak evidence that the rate of adaptive evolution is correlated to synonymous diversity. We interpret this as evidence that at least some adaptive evolution is limited by the supply of mutations.},

abstract = {Is a key theory of evolutionary and conservation biologyâthat loss of genetic diver- sity can be predicted from population sizeâon shaky ground? In the face of increas- ing human-induced species depletion and habitat fragmentation, this question and the study of genetic diversity in small populations are paramount to understanding the limits of species' responses to environmental change and to providing remedies to endangered species conservation. Few empirical studies have investigated to what degree some small populations might be buffered against losses of genetic diversity. Even fewer studies have experimentally tested the potential underlying mechanisms. The study of Schou, Loeschcke, Bechsgaard, Schlotterer, and Kris- tensen (2017) in this issue of Molecular Ecology is elegant in combining classic com- mon garden experimentation with population genomics on an iconic experimental model species (Drosophila melanogaster). The authors reveal a slower rate of loss of genetic diversity in small populations under varying thermal regimes than theoreti- cally expected and hence an unexpected retention of genetic diversity. They are fur- ther able to hone in on a plausible mechanism: associative overdominance, wherein homozygosity of deleterious recessive alleles is especially disfavoured in genomic regions of low recombination. These results contribute to a budding literature on the varying mechanisms underlying genetic diversity in small populations and encourage further such research towards the effective management and conserva- tion of fragmented or endangered populations.},

While many authors have explored the biological impacts of intensive wild population management, primarily with respect to disease transmission (especially in ungulates and fish), the evolutionary and demographic effects of wildlife ranching have been examined less intensively. We discuss this issue through the case of intensive wildlife management in southern Africa. The genetic consequences of this global practice, with an emphasis on Africa, were addressed by a motion passed at the 2016 IUCN World Congress- âManagement and regulation of intensive breeding and genetic manipulation of large mammals for commercial purposes'. Here, we highlight concerns regarding intensive breeding programs used to discover, enhance and propagate unusual physical traits, hereafter referred to as âIntentional Genetic Manipulation'. We highlight how âIntentional Genetic Manipulation' potentially threatens the viability of native species and ecosystems, via genetic erosion, inbreeding, hybridisation and unregulated translocation. Finally, we discuss the need for better policies in southern Africa and globally, regarding âIntentional Genetic Manipulation', and the identification of key knowledge gaps.},

abstract = {Adaptive differences across species' ranges can have important implications for population persistence and conservation management decisions. Despite advances in genomic technologies, detecting adaptive variation in natural populations remains challenging. Key challenges in gene-environment association studies involve distinguishing the effects of drift from those of selection, and identifying subtle signatures of polygenic adaptation. We used paired-end restriction-site associated-DNA sequencing data (6605 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) to examine population structure and test for signatures of adaptation across the geographic range of an iconic Australian endemic freshwater fish species, the Murray cod Maccullochella peelii. Two univariate gene-association methods identified 61 genomic regions associated with climate variation. We also tested for subtle signatures of polygenic adaptation using a multivariate method (redundancy analysis; RDA). The RDA analysis suggested that climate (temperature- and precipitation-related variables) and geography had similar magnitudes of effect in shaping the distribution of SNP genotypes across the sampled range of Murray cod. Although there was poor agreement among the candidate SNPs identified by the univariate methods, the top 5{\%} of SNPs contributing to significant RDA axes included 67{\%} of the SNPs identified by univariate methods. We discuss the potential implications of our findings for the management of Murray cod and other species generally, particularly in relation to informing conservation actions such as translocations to improve evolutionary resilience of natural populations. Our results highlight the value of using a combination of different approaches, including polygenic methods, when testing for signatures of adaptation in landscape genomics studies.

abstract = {Nucleic acid amplification is a powerful molecular biology tool, although its use outside the modern laboratory environment is limited due to the relatively cumbersome methods required to extract nucleic acids from biological samples. To address this issue, we investigated a variety of materials for their suitability for nucleic acid capture and purification. We report here that untreated cellulose-based paper can rapidly capture nucleic acids within seconds and retain them during a single washing step, while contaminants present in complex biological samples are quickly removed. Building on this knowledge, we have successfully created an equipment-free nucleic acid extraction dipstick methodology that can obtain amplification-ready DNA and RNA from plants, animals, and microbes from difficult biological samples such as blood and leaves from adult trees in less than 30 seconds. The simplicity and speed of this method as well as the low cost and availability of suitable materials (e.g., common paper towelling), means that nucleic acid extraction is now more accessible and affordable for researchers and the broader community. Furthermore, when combined with recent advancements in isothermal amplification and naked eye DNA visualization techniques, the dipstick extraction technology makes performing molecular diagnostic assays achievable in limited resource settings including university and high school classrooms, field-based environments, and developing countries.},

abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental process governing the ecological and evolutionary dynam- ics of any given species. Due to inherent challenges associated with measuring dispersal directly, identi- fying proxies for dispersal capacity has long been an active field of research across ecosystems. In marine systems, pelagic larval duration (PLD) has been one of the most widely used indicators of interspecific dispersal potential. The validity of this proxy, however, relies mostly on the assumption of entirely passive dispersal, a notion that has been challenged by findings of strong larval behavioural capabilities. Here, we assessed the effect of larval swimming capacities measured as mean critical swimming speed (U-crit) on emergent species-level properties related to dispersal potential, population genetic structure and global range size, in demer- sal marine fishes. In a meta-analytic framework, we tested the relative importance of U-crit versus other in trinsic (PLD, egg type, adult body size) and extrinsic (genetic marker type, study scale) predic- tors of isolation-by-distance slope, global FST and range size. U-crit showed stronger relationships with all emergent response variables than PLD and was consistently the most important predictor in multi-model inference. Our findings indicate that lar val swimming capacities could serve as a power ful indicator of a species' long-distance dis- persal},

abstract = {Biophysical models are being used increas- ingly, both as predictive tools of larval dispersal for a particular system and for general evaluation of the role of different factors in larval transport. In the results of such models, larval duration, mortality, and behavior in the water column have exhibited pronounced effects on larval dis- persal of marine benthic invertebrates. The parameterization of these processes has broadly reflected values from labo- ratory experiments, but the accuracy of these values is unknown. The pelagic larval duration used in models should be determined by laboratory, or preferably field, studies and should incorporate environmentally dependent variability. For mortality, in situ estimates are now feasible and, likely, more accurate than the currently used values. Larval behav- ior can be measured in the field, by high-frequency sam- pling of distributional changes relative to features in the water column or by controlled larval releases in tractable systems. To successfully validate the outcomes of these models, we must either improve our techniques for measur- ing larval abundance at the end of larval transport immedi- ately before settlement, or incorporate components for set- tlement into the models. We must also address the mismatch in sampling resolution between biological and physical pro- cesses. If used with caution, this powerful approach can significantly advance our understanding of larval transport},

We used population genomic analyses, including phylogenetic reconstruction, Bayesian clustering, genetic distances, Discriminant Analyses of Principal Components, and coalescence simulations for detection of outlier SNPs, to understand genetic trends relevant to the lionfish's long-term persistence. We found no significant differences in genetic structure or diversity between the two areas (FST p-valuesâ{\textgreater}â0.01, and t-test p-valuesâ{\textgreater}â0.05). In fact, our genomic analyses showed genetic homogeneity, with enough gene flow between the east coast of Florida and Gulf of Mexico to erase previous signals of genetic divergence detected between these areas, secondary spreading, and bottlenecks in the Gulf of Mexico.

abstract = {Pedigree information among individuals has become a key factor in the correct management and conservation of wild populations, as well as captive stocks. Despite the growing interest in the identification and application of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, to date, microsatellite loci continues to be considered as the genetic marker par excellence to establish the degree of relationship among individuals. In fact, although high-density SNP panels are a highly accurate tool for inferring kinship relationships, at small-scale, with only a reduced number of SNPs involved, it is difficult to preserve that accuracy due to the bi-allelic nature of this genetic marker. The present study has evaluated the accuracy of SNP-haplotypes (genotypic combination of single SNPs located in the same gene) as parentage and relatedness tool in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Initially, by direct sequencing of 11 genes in a set of 30 unrelated individuals with heterogeneous origin, a total of 398 putative SNPs were identified and, by means of a filtering procedure to remove false positive and SNPs in a very low frequency, 164 SNPs were selected for the final panel. Using the iPLEX Gold MassARRAY technology, a subset of 58 SNPs located in 7 genes were genotyped in 424 individuals organized into two broodstocks (54 breeders and 370 offspring with pedigree previously inferred by microsatellite loci). From the obtained genotype data, a SNP-haplotype reconstruction was carried out for each gene. According to this approach, 58 biallelic single SNPs were turned into 7 multi-allelic markers (1 gene = 1 marker) whose allele (haplotype) number ranged from 3 to 41. This SNP-haplotypes resolved parentage assignment with an accuracy higher than 99{\%}, resulting in a 10.5{\%} and 3.5{\%} more accuracy than the set of 58 SNPs and 9 microsatellite loci, respectively. Likewise, under a scenario in which ancestral information was not available, SNP-haplotypes showed an accuracy similar than microsatellite loci for discriminating unrelated individuals. Using this approach, a proportion close to 94{\%} of unrelated individuals correctly classified for the coefficient of relationship equal to zero (theoretically expected relatedness value between unrelated individuals) was achieved. The 6{\%} of individuals, misclassified as unrelated, were largely half-sibs since the full-sibs did not exceed 0.03{\%}. In conclusion, we report herein that SNP-haplotypes approach represents a highly efficient alternative to microsatellite loci to infer parentage and assess relatedness.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged â¥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Ecological and environmental variables play amajor role in the genetic structure ofmarine populations, but how oceanography affects their dispersal and associated connectivity remains far from being understood. To account for the effect of different dispersal strategies in terms of pelagic larvae and non-pelagic reproduction,we utilize the power of comparative phylogeographic analyses of five phylogenetically and functionally diverse intertidal species along the west coast of South Africa using population genetics and biophysical models within the Benguela Current system. Some broadcast spawners exhibit genetic panmixia, others show genetic structure similar to direct-developing species, suggesting complex recruitment patterns in rocky shore environments. Patterns of genetic structure do not correspond with pelagic larval competency period, with a broadcast spawning urchin displaying the highest levels of population structure. Biophysicalmodels of larval dispersal revealmixed dispersal patterns, with the strongest connections in a northward direction following the Benguela Current, yet most modeled species also show the capacity for southward (albeit weaker) migration among some sample localities. Some sites, particularly the most northern areas, show very low levels of potential connectivity. Lastly, we synthesized our results to highlight key areas for the development of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that capture the evolutionary patterns of marine species of the west coast and find that the results from our molecular and biophysical analyses are coherent with previous suggestions for a network of protected areas},

abstract = {Abstract Climate change and increasing habitat loss greatly impact species survival, requiring range shifts, phenotypic plasticity and/or evolutionary change for long-term persistence, which may not readily occur unaided in threatened species. Therefore, defining conservation actions requires a detailed assessment of evolutionary factors. Existing genetic diversity needs to be thoroughly evaluated and spatially mapped to define conservation units (CUs) in an evolutionary context, and we address that here. We also propose a multidisciplinary approach to determine corridors and functional connectivity between CUs by including genetic diversity in the modelling while controlling for isolation by distance and phylogeographic history. We evaluate our approach on a Near Threatened Iberian endemic rodent by analysing genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) genomic data from 107 Cabrera voles (Microtus cabrerae), screening the entire species distribution to define categories of CUs and their connectivity: We defined six management units (MUs) which can be grouped into four evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and three (putatively) adaptive units (AUs). We demonstrate that the three different categories of CU can be objectively defined using genomic data, and their characteristics and connectivity can inform conservation decision-making. In particular, we show that connectivity of the Cabrera vole is very limited in eastern Iberia and that the pre-Pyrenean and part of the Betic geographic nuclei contribute the most to the species genetic diversity. We argue that a multidisciplinary framework for CU definition is essential and that this framework needs a strong evolutionary basis.},

abstract = {Sequencing reducedârepresentation libraries of restriction siteâassociated DNA (RADseq) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is quickly becoming a standard methodology for molecular ecologists. Because of the scale of RADseq data sets, putative loci cannot be assessed individually, making the process of filtering noise and correctly identifying biologically meaningful signal more difficult. Artefacts introduced during library preparation and/or bioinformatic processing of SNP data can create patterns that are incorrectly interpreted as indicative of population structure or natural selection. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider types of errors that may be introduced during laboratory work and data processing, and how to minimize, detect and remove these errors. Here, we discuss issues inherent to RADseq methodologies that can result in artefacts during library preparation and locus reconstruction resulting in erroneous SNP calls and, ultimately, genotyping error. Further, we describe steps that can be implemented to create a rigorously filtered data set consisting of markers accurately representing independent loci and compare the effect of different combinations of filters on four RAD data sets. At last, we stress the importance of publishing raw sequence data along with final filtered data sets in addition to detailed documentation of filtering steps and quality control measures.},

abstract = {It is well known that the spawning grounds of chokka squid Loligo reynaudii lie along the shallow inshore regions of South Africa's south coast. However, egg masses have been found in deeper water on the Agulhas Bank, and hydroacoustic targets deemed to be large aggregations of spawning squid have been identified. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent, depth range, and importance of deep spawning. Trawl data collected during demersal research surveys between Port Nolloth on the west and Port Alfred on the south coast were examined for egg capsules. No spawning was found on the west coast. Data showed that chokka squid preferred the eastern Agulhas Bank for spawning. Spawning occurred not only inshore but also on the mid-shelf extending to depths of 270 m near the shelf edge. Squid egg biomass markedly decreased beyond 70 m, suggesting delineation between the inshore and offshore spawning grounds. Total egg biomass calculations for depths shallower and deeper than 70 m indicated the coastal area to be strongly favoured, i.e. 82 vs. 18{\%}. These results contest the commonly accepted notion that L. reynaudii is an inshore spawner and redefine the spawning grounds to extend across the shelf.},

abstract = {Ports and farms are well-known primary introduction hot spots for marine non-indigenous species (NIS). The extent to which these anthropogenic habitats are sustainable sources of propagules and influence the evolution of NIS in natural habitats was examined in the edible seaweed Undaria pinnatifida, native to Asia and introduced to Europe in the 1970s. Following its deliberate introduction 40 years ago along the French coast of the English Channel, this kelp is now found in three contrasting habitat types: farms, marinas and natural rocky reefs. In the light of the continuous spread of this NIS, it is imperative to better understand the processes behind its sustainable establishment in the wild. In addition, developing effective management plans to curtail the spread of U. pinnatifida requires determining how the three types of populations interact with one another. In addition to an analysis using microsatellite markers, we developed, for the first time in a kelp, a ddRAD-sequencing technique to genotype 738 individuals sampled in 11 rocky reefs, 12 marinas, and two farms located along ca. 1,000 km of coastline. As expected, the RAD-seq panel showed more power than the microsatel-lite panel for identifying fine-grained patterns. However, both panels demonstrated habitat-specific properties of the study populations. In particular, farms displayed very low genetic diversity and no inbreeding conversely to populations in marinas and natural rocky reefs. In addition, strong, but chaotic regional genetic structure, was revealed , consistent with human-mediated dispersal (e.g., leisure boating). We also uncovered a tight relationship between populations in rocky reefs and those in nearby marinas, but not with nearby farms, suggesting spillover from marinas into the wild. At last, a temporal survey spanning 20 generations showed that wild populations are now self-sustaining, albeit there was no evidence for local adaptation to any of the three habitats. These findings highlight that limiting the spread of U. pinnatifida requires efficient management policies that also target marinas.

abstract = {Genomic tools are increasingly being used on non-model organisms to provide insights into population structure and variability, including signals of selection. However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context.},

abstract = {The genetic impact of farmed fish escaping aquaculture is a highly debated issue. However, non-target species, such as cleaner fish used to remove sea lice from farmed fish, are rarely considered. Here, we report that wild corkwing wrasse ( Symphodus melops ), which are transported long distances to be used as cleaner fish in salmon farms, escape and hybridize with local populations. Recently, increasing numbers of corkwing wrasse have been reported in Flatanger in Norway, north of its described distribution range, an area heavily relying on the import of cleaner fish from Skagerrak. Using genetic markers identified with 2bRAD sequencing, we show that, although the Flatanger population largely is a result of a northward range expansion, there is also evidence of considerable gene flow from southern populations in Skagerrak and Kattegat. Of the 40 corkwing wrasses sampled in Flatanger, we discovered two individuals with clear southern genotypes, one first-generation hybrid, and 12 potential second-generation hybrids. In summary, we provide evidence that corkwing wrasse escape from fish farms and hybridize with local populations at the leading edge of an ongoing range expansion. Although the magnitude and significance of escapees warrant further investigation, these results should be taken into consideration in the use of translocated cleaner fish.},

abstract = {The genetic population structure of many species is characterised by a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD): due to limited dispersal, individuals that are geographically close tend to be genetically more similar than individuals that are far apart. Despite the ubiquity of IBD in nature, many commonly used statistical tests are based on a null model that is completely non-spatial, the Island model. Here, I argue that patterns of spatial autocorrelation deriving from IBD present a problem for such tests as it can severely bias their outcome. I use simulated data to illustrate this problem for two widely used types of tests: tests of hierarchical population structure and the detection of loci under selection. My results show that for both types of tests the presence of IBD can indeed lead to a large number of false positives. I therefore argue that all analyses in a study should take the spatial dependence in the data into account, unless it can be shown that there is no spatial autocorrelation in the allele frequency distribution that is under investigation. Thus, it is urgent to develop additional statistical approaches that are based on a spatially explicit null model instead of the non-spatial Island model.},

New applications, techniques and criticisms of techniques appear like clockwork with each new journal issue. The developments are an encouraging, and at times bewildering, sign of progress in an exciting new field of study. However, we suggest that the rapid expansion of landscape genetics has belied important flaws in the development of the field, and we add an air of caution to this breakneck pace of expansion. Specifically, landscape genetic studies often lose sight of the fundamental principles and complex consequences of gene flow, instead favoring simplistic interpretations and broad inferences not necessarily warranted by the data. Here, we describe common pitfalls that characterize such studies, and provide practical guidance to improve landscape genetic investigation, with careful consideration of inferential limits, scale, replication, and the ecological and evolutionary context of spatial genetic patterns. Ultimately, the utility of landscape genetics will depend on translating the relationship between gene flow and landscape features into an understanding of long-term population outcomes. We hope the perspective presented here will steer landscape genetics down a more scientifically sound and productive path, garnering a field that is as informative in the future as it is popular now This article is protected by copyright.

Technological developments in molecular genetics have led to extensive use of neutral molecular markers such as microsatellites in conservation biology. This has allowed assessment of the impact of genetic drift on genetic variation, of the level of inbreeding within populations, and of the amount of gene flow between or within populations. Recent developments in genomic techniques, including next generation sequencing, whole genome scans and gene-expression pattern analysis, have made it possible to step up from a limited number of neutral markers to genome-wide estimates of functional genetic variation.

The first studies to put the next generation sequencing (NGS) to the test in ecologically well-characterized species without previous genome information were published in 2007 and the beginning of 2008. Since then several studies have followed in their footsteps, and a large number are undoubtedly under way. This review focuses on how NGS has been, and can be, applied to ecological, population genetic and conservation genetic studies of non-model species, in which there is no (or very limited) genomic resources. Our aim is to draw attention to the various possibilities that are opening up using the new technologies, but we also highlight some of the pitfalls and drawbacks with these methods.

The determinants of this variation have been poorly understood, but population genomic data from a wide range of organisms now make it possible to delineate the underlying evolutionary processes, notably how variation in the effective population size (Ne) governs genetic diversity. Comparative population genomics is on its way to providing a solution to 'Lewontin's paradox' [mdash] the discrepancy between the many orders of magnitude of variation in population size and the much narrower distribution of diversity levels. It seems that linked selection plays an important part both in the overall genetic diversity of a species and in the variation in diversity within the genome.

abstract = {Reference is regularly made to the power of new genomic sequencing approaches. Using powerful technology, however, is not the same as having the necessary power to address a research question with statistical robustness. In the rush to adopt new and improved genomic research methods, limitations of technology and experimental design may be initially neglected. Here, we review these issues with regard to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq adds large-scale transcriptomics to the toolkit of ecological and evolutionary biologists, enabling differential gene expression (DE) studies in non-model species without the need for prior genomic resources. High biological variance is typical of field-based gene expression studies and means that larger sample sizes are often needed to achieve the same degree of statistical power as clinical studies based on data from cell lines or inbred animal models. Sequencing costs have plummeted, yet RNA-seq studies still underutilise biological replication. Finite research budgets force a trade-off between sequencing effort and replication in RNA-seq experimental design. However, clear guidelines for negotiating this trade-off, while taking into account study-specific factors affecting power, are currently lacking. Study designs that prioritise sequencing depth over replication fail to capitalise on the power of RNA-seq technology for DE inference. Significant recent research effort has gone into developing statistical frameworks and software tools for power analysis and sample size calculation in the context of RNA-seq DE analysis. We synthesise progress in this area and derive an accessible rule-of-thumb guide for designing powerful RNA-seq experiments relevant in eco-evolutionary and clinical settings alike},

abstract = {Most of the major genetic concerns in conservation biology, including inbreeding depression, loss of evolutionary potential, genetic adaptation to captivity and outbreeding depression, involve quantitative genetics. Small population size leads to inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity and so increases extinction risk. Captive populations of endangered species are managed to maximize the retention of genetic diversity by minimizing kinship, with subsidiary efforts to minimize inbreeding. There is growing evidence that genetic adaptation to captivity is a major issue in the genetic management of captive populations of endangered species as it reduces reproductive fitness when captive populations are reintroduced into the wild. This problem is not currently addressed, but it can be alleviated by deliberately fragmenting captive populations, with occasional exchange of immigrants to avoid excessive inbreeding. The extent and importance of outbreeding depression is a matter of controversy. Currently, an extremely cautious approach is taken to mixing populations. However, this cannot continue if fragmented populations are to be adequately managed to minimize extinctions. Most genetic management recommendations for endangered species arise directly, or indirectly, from quantitative genetic considerations.},

Roughly 98{\%} of the human genome is composed of repeats and intergenic or non-protein-coding sequences. Thus, it is crucial to focus resequencing on high-value genomic regions. Protein-coding exons represent one such type of high-value target. We have developed a method of using flexible, high-density microarrays to capture any desired fraction of the human genome, in this case corresponding to more than 200,000 protein-coding exons. Depending on the precise protocol, up to 55-85{\%} of the captured fragments are associated with targeted regions and up to 98{\%} of intended exons can be recovered. This methodology provides an adaptable route toward rapid and efficient resequencing of any sizeable, non-repeat portion of the human genome.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Populations of many nearshore marine species are connected through the dispersal of their larvae. In this paper, larval connectivity patterns in the Southern California Bight are explored using 2 quantities: potential and realized larval connectivity. Potential connectivity is defined as the probability of larval transport from a source to a destination location and is quantified using Lagrangian particle simulations. Realized connectivity is the product of potential connectivity with larval production and can be used to estimate larval settlement patterns. Potential and realized connectivity patterns are quantified for kelp bass \textit{Paralabrax clathratus}, kelp rockfish \textit{Sebastes atrovirens}, and red abalone \textit{Haliotis rufescens}, 3 species with a range of larval dispersal characteristics. Connectivity patterns were found to be both heterogeneous, with locations having different source and destination strengths, and asymmetric, with directionality in larval transport. Both potential and realized connectivity were strongly influenced by the length and timing of the spawning season as well as planktonic larval duration. For kelp bass and kelp rockfish, a strong correspondence was found between realized and potential destination locations, suggesting that circulation processes have a dominant role in shaping the spatial distribution of these 2 species. Strong temporal variability in realized larval connectivity was observed on seasonal and inter-annual time scales (particularly between El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o and La Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;a conditions). These results provide novel information for use in marine fisheries and conservation management.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity of ecological structures originates either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes. In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical simulations and an artificial pseudo-ecological data set of known properties. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {F(ST) outlier tests are a potentially powerful way to detect genetic loci under spatially divergent selection. Unfortunately, the extent to which these tests are robust to nonequilibrium demographic histories has been understudied. We developed a landscape genetics simulator to test the effects of isolation by distance (IBD) and range expansion on FST outlier methods. We evaluated the two most commonly used methods for the identification of F(ST) outliers (FDIST2 and BayeScan, which assume samples are evolutionarily independent) and two recent methods (FLK and Bayenv2, which estimate and account for evolutionary nonindependence). Parameterization with a set of neutral loci ('neutral parameterization') always improved the performance of FLK and Bayenv2, while neutral parameterization caused FDIST2 to actually perform worse in the cases of IBD or range expansion. BayeScan was improved when the prior odds on neutrality was increased, regardless of the true odds in the data. On their best performance, however, the widely used methods had high false-positive rates for IBD and range expansion and were outperformed by methods that accounted for evolutionary nonindependence. In addition, default settings in FDIST2 and BayeScan resulted in many false positives suggesting balancing selection. However, all methods did very well if a large set of neutral loci is available to create empirical P-values. We conclude that in species that exhibit IBD or have undergone range expansion, many of the published FST outliers based on FDIST2 and BayeScan are probably false positives, but FLK and Bayenv2 show great promise for accurately identifying loci under spatially divergent selection.},

abstract = {Accurately detecting signatures of local adaptation using genetic-environment associations (GEAs) requires controlling for neutral patterns of population structure to reduce the risk of false positives. However, a high degree of collinearity between climatic gradients and neutral population structure can greatly reduce power, and the performance of GEA methods in such case is rarely evaluated in empirical studies. In this study, we attempted to disentangle the effects of local adaptation and isolation by environment (IBE) from those of isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by colonization from glacial refugia (IBC) using range-wide samples in two white pine species. For this, SNPs from 168 genes, including 52 candidate genes for growth and phenology, were genotyped in 133 and 61 populations of Pinus strobus and P. monticola, respectively. For P. strobus and using all 153 SNPs, climate (IBE) did not significantly explained among-population variation when controlling for IBD and IBC in redundancy analyses (RDAs). However, 26 SNPs were significantly associated with climate in single-locus GEA analyses (Bayenv2 and LFMM), suggesting that local adaptation took place in the presence of high gene flow. For P. monticola, we found no evidence of IBE using RDAs and weaker signatures of local adaptation using GEA and FST outlier tests, consistent with adaptation via phenotypic plasticity. In both species, the majority of the explained among-population variation (69 to 96{\%}) could not be partitioned between the effects of IBE, IBD, and IBC. GEA methods can account differently for this confounded variation, and this could explain the small overlap of SNPs detected between Bayenv2 and LFMM. Our study illustrates the inherent difficulty of taking into account neutral structure in natural populations and the importance of sampling designs that maximize climatic variation, while minimizing collinearity between climatic gradients and neutral structure.},

abstract = {Geographically limited dispersal can shape genetic population structure and result in a correlation between genetic and geographic distance, commonly called isolation-by-distance. Despite the prevalence of isolation-by-distance in nature, to date few studies have empirically demonstrated the processes that generate this pattern, largely because few populations have direct measures of individual dispersal and pedigree information. Intensive, long-term demographic studies and exhaustive genomic surveys in the Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of dispersal on genetic structure. Here, we used a panel of genome-wide SNPs and extensive pedigree information to explore the role of limited dispersal in shaping patterns of isolation-by-distance in both sexes, and at an exceedingly fine spatial scale (within {\~{}}10 km). Isolation-by-distance patterns were stronger in male-male and male-female comparisons than in female-female comparisons, consistent with observed differences in dispersal propensity between the sexes. Using the pedigree, we demonstrated how various genealogical relationships contribute to fine-scale isolation-by-distance. Simulations using field-observed distributions of male and female natal dispersal distances showed good agreement with the distribution of geographic distances between breeding individuals of different pedigree relationship classes. Furthermore, we built coalescent simulations parameterized by the observed dispersal curve, population density, and immigration rate, and showed how incorporating these extensions to Mal{\'{e}}cot's theory of isolation-by-distance allows us to accurately reconstruct observed sex-specific isolation-by-distance patterns in autosomal and Z-linked SNPs. Therefore, patterns of fine-scale isolation-by-distance in the Florida Scrub-Jay can be well understood as a result of limited dispersal over contemporary timescales.},

However, spatial variations of demographic parameters such as migration rate or population density can generate non-stationary patterns of isolation-by-distance where the rate at which genetic differentiation accumulates varies across space. To characterize non-stationary patterns of isolation-by-distance, we infer local genetic differentiation based on Bayesian kriging. Local genetic differentiation for a sampled population is defined as the average genetic differentiation between the sampled population and fictive neighboring populations. To avoid defining populations in advance, the method can also be applied at the scale of individuals making it relevant for landscape genetics. Inference of local genetic differentiation relies on a matrix of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity between populations or individuals such as matrices of FST between pairs of populations. Simulation studies show that maps of local genetic differentiation can reveal barriers to gene flow but also other patterns such as continuous variations of gene flow across habitat. The potential of the method is illustrated with 2 data sets: genome-wide SNP data for human Swedish populations and AFLP markers for alpine plant species. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale genotype datasets can help track the dispersal patterns of epidemiological outbreaks and predict the geographic origins of individuals. Such genetically-based geographic assignments also show a range of possible applications in forensics for profiling both victims and criminals, and in wildlife management, where poaching hotspot areas can be located. They, however, require fast and accurate statistical methods to handle the growing amount of genetic information made available from genotype arrays and next-generation sequencing technologies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce a novel statistical method for geopositioning individuals of unknown origin from genotypes. Our method is based on a geostatistical model trained with a dataset of georeferenced genotypes. Statistical inference under this model can be implemented within the theoretical framework of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), which represents one of the major recent breakthroughs in statistics, as it does not require Monte Carlo simulations. We compare the performance of our method and an alternative method for geospatial inference, SPA in a simulation framework. We highlight the accuracy and limits of continuous spatial assignment methods at various scales by analyzing genotype datasets from a diversity of species, including Florida scrub jay birds Aphelocoma coerulescens, Arabidopsis thaliana and humans, representing 41 to 197,146 SNPs. Our method appears to be best suited for the analysis of medium-size datasets (a few tens of thousands of loci), such as reduced-representation sequencing data that become increasingly available in ecology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/{\~{}}gigu/Spasiba/ CONTACT: gilles.b.guillot@gmail.com.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of RAD-Seq data in phylogeography means genealogical relationships previously evaluated using relatively few genetic markers can now be addressed with thousands of loci. One challenge, however, is that RAD-Seq generates complete genotypes for only a small subset of loci or individuals. Simulations indicate that loci with missing data can produce biased estimates of key population genetic parameters, although the influence of such biases in empirical studies is not well understood. Here we compare microsatellite data (8 loci) and RAD-Seq data (six datasets ranging from 239 to 25,198 loci) from red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) in Florida to evaluate how different levels of data filtering influence phylogeographic inferences. For all datasets, we calculated population genetic statistics and evaluated population structure, and for RAD-Seq datasets, we additionally examined population structure using coalescence. We found higher F ST using microsatellites, but that RAD-Seq-based estimates approached those based on microsatellites as more loci with more missing data were included. Analyses of RAD-Seq datasets resolved the classic Gulf-Atlantic coastal phylogeographic break, which was not significant in the microsatellite analyses. Applying multiple levels of filtering to RAD-Seq datasets can provide a more complete picture of potential biases in the data and elucidate subtle phylogeographic patterns.},

abstract = {There is a lack of consensus on how next-generation sequence data should be considered for phylogenetic and phylogeographic estimates, with some studies excluding loci with missing data, while others include them, even when sequences are missing from a large number of individuals. Here we use simulations, focusing specifically on RAD sequences, to highlight some of the unforeseen consequence of excluding missing data from next-generation sequencing. Specifically, we show that in addition to the obvious effects associated with reducing the amount of data used to make historical inferences, the decisions we make about missing data (such as the minimum number of individuals with a sequence for a locus to be included in the study) also impact the types of loci sampled for a study. In particular, as the tolerance for missing data becomes more stringent, the mutational spectrum represented in the sampled loci becomes truncated such that loci with the highest mutation rates are disproportionately excluded. This effect is exacerbated further by factors involved in the preparation of the genomic library (i.e., the use of reduced representation libraries, as well as the coverage) and the taxonomic diversity represented in the library (i.e., the level of divergence among the individuals). We demonstrate that the intuitive appeals about being conservative by removing loci may be misguided.},

abstract = {20 Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. 21 Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on 22 correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate 23 methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and 24 environment. Multivariate methods, which analyze many loci simultaneously, may be better 25 suited to these data since they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. 26 These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, 27 multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods, and five univariate and 28 differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found 29 that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low 30 detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations showed a superior 31 combination of low false positive and high true positive rates across all levels of selection. These 32 results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes, and levels 33 of population structure tested. The value of combining detections from different methods was 34 variable, and depended on study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Reanalysis of 35 genomic data from gray wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could 36 be identified using redundancy analysis, a constrained ordination. Although additional testing is 37 needed, this study indicates that constrained ordinations are an effective means of detecting 38 adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for 39 investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation. 40 3 Introduction},

abstract = {Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in modern evolutionary biology. Phylogenetic methods reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among organisms, whereas phylodynamic approaches reveal the underlying diversification processes that lead to the observed relationships. These two fields have many practical applications in disciplines as diverse as epidemiology, developmental biology, palaeontology, ecology, and linguistics. The combination of increasingly large genetic data sets and increases in computing power is facilitating the development of more sophisticated phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods. Big data sets allow us to answer complex questions. However, since the required analyses are highly specific to the particular data set and question, a black-box method is not sufficient anymore. Instead, biologists are required to be actively involved with modeling decisions during data analysis. The modular design of the Bayesian phylogenetic software package BEAST 2 enables, and in fact enforces, this involvement. At the same time, the modular design enables computational biology groups to develop new methods at a rapid rate. A thorough understanding of the models and algorithms used by inference software is a critical prerequisite for successful hypothesis formulation and assessment. In particular, there is a need for more readily available resources aimed at helping interested scientists equip themselves with the skills to confidently use cutting-edge phylogenetic analysis software. These resources will also benefit researchers who do not have access to similar courses or training at their home institutions. Here, we introduce the âTaming the Beastâ (https://taming-the-beast.github.io/) resource, which was developed as part of a workshop series bearing the same name, to facilitate the usage of the Bayesian phylogenetic software package BEAST 2.

MCMC approaches generate samples of model parameter values - including the phylogenetic tree -drawn from their posterior distribution given molecular sequence data and a selection of evolutionary models. Visualising, tabulating and marginalising these samples is critical for approximating the posterior quantities of interest that one reports as the outcome of a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.

abstract = {Aim: To determine which seascape features have shaped the spatial genetic patterns of coral reef fishes, and to identify common patterns among species related to dispersal traits [egg type and pelagic larval duration (PLD)]. Location: Indian and Pacific Oceans, including the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Methods: We sampled coral reef fishes with differing dispersal traits (Pomacentrus coelestis, Dascyllus trimaculatus, Hailchoeres hortulanus and Acanthurus triostegus) and characterized spatial (mtDNA) genetic patterns using AMOVA-clustering and measures of genetic differentiation. Similarity in the spatial genetic patterns among species was assessed using the congruence among distance matrices method and the seascape features associated with the genetic differentiation of each species were identified using multiple regression of distance matrices (MRDM) and stepwise model selection. Results: Similar spatial genetic patterns were found for P. coelestis and H. hortulanus, despite their differing egg type (benthic versus pelagic). MRDM indicated that geographical distance was underlying their correlated genetic patterns. Species with pelagic eggs (A. triostegus and H. hortulanus) also had correlated patterns of genetic differentiation (Dest); however, a common underlying seascape feature could not be inferred. Additionally, the common influence of the Torres Strait and the Lydekker/Weber's line was identified for the genetic patterns of differentiation for P. coelestis and A. triostegus, despite their differing dispersal traits, and the uncorrelated spatial genetic patterns of these species. Main conclusions: Our study demonstrates the value of a quantitative, hypothesis-testing framework in comparative phylogeography. We found that dispersal traits (egg type and PLD) did not predict which species had similar spatial genetic patterns or which seascape features were associated with these patterns. Furthermore, even in the absence of visually similar, or correlated spatial genetic patterns, our approach enabled us to identify seascape features that had a common influence on the spatial genetic patterns of co-distributed species.},

abstract = {Dispersal of planktonic larvae can create connections between geographically separated adult populations of benthic marine animals. How geographic context and life history traits affect these connections is largely unresolved. We use data from genetic studies (species level FST) of benthic teleost fishes combined with linear models to evaluate the importance of transitions between biogeographic regions, geographic distance, egg type (benthic or pelagic eggs), pelagic larval duration (PLD), and type of genetic marker as factors affecting differentiation within species. We find that transitions between biogeographic regions and egg type are significant and consistent contributors to population genetic structure, whereas PLD does not significantly explain population structure. Total study distance frequently contributes to significant interaction terms, particularly in association with genetic markers, whereby FST increases with study distance for studies employing mtDNA sequences, but allozyme and microsatellite studies show no increase in FST with study distance. These results highlight the importance of spatial context (biogeography and geographic distance) in affecting genetic differentiation and imply that there are inherent differences in dispersal ability associated with egg type. We also find that the geographic distance over which the maximum pairwise FST between populations occurs (relative to total study distance) is highly variable and can be observed at any scale. This result is consistent with stochastic processes inflating genetic differentiation and/or insufficient consideration of geographic and biological factors relevant to connectivity},

abstract = {Many nearshore fish and invertebrate populations are overexploited even when apparently coherent management structures are in place. One potential cause of mismanagement may be a poor understanding and accounting of stochasticity, particularly for stock recruitment. Many of the fishes and invertebrates that comprise nearshore fisheries are relatively sedentary as adults but have an obligate larval pelagic stage that is dispersed by ocean currents. Here, we demonstrate that larval connectivity is inherently an intermittent and heterogeneous process on annual time scales. This stochasticity arises from the advection of pelagic larvae by chaotic coastal circulations. This result departs from typical assumptions where larvae simply diffuse from one site to another or where complex connectivity patterns are created by transport within spatially complicated environments. We derive a statistical model for the expected variability in larval settlement patterns and demonstrate how larval connectivity varies as a function of different biological and physical processes. The stochastic nature of larval connectivity creates an unavoidable uncertainty in the assessment of fish recruitment and the resulting forecasts of sustainable yields.},

abstract = {1. Meta-analysis is a powerful and informative tool for basic and applied research. It provides a statistical framework for synthesizing and comparing the results of studies which have all tested a particular hypothesis. Meta-analysis has the potential to be particularly useful for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, as individual experiments often rely on small sample sizes due to the constraints of time and manpower, and therefore have low statistical power. 2. The rewards of conducting a meta-analysis can be significant. It can be the basis of a systematic review of a topic that provides a powerful exploration of key hypotheses or theoretical assumptions, thereby influencing the future development of a field of research. Alternatively, for the applied scientist, it can provide robust answers to questions of ecological, medical or economic significance. However, planning and conducting a meta-analysis can be a daunting prospect and the analysis itself is invariably demanding and labour intensive. Errors or omissions made at the planning stage can create weeks of extra work. 3. While a range of useful resources is available to help the budding meta-analyst on his or her way, much of the key information and explanation is spread across different articles and textbooks. In order to help the reader use the available information as efficiently as possible (and so avoid making time-consuming errors) this article aims to provide a âroad map' to the existing literature. It provides a brief guide to planning, organizing and implementing a meta-analysis which focuses more on logic and implementation than on maths; it is intended to be a first port of call for those interested in the topic and should be used in conjunction with the more detailed books and articles referenced. In the main, references are cited and discussed with an emphasis on useful reading order rather than a chronological history of meta-analysis and its uses. 4. No prior knowledge of meta-analysis is assumed in the current article, though it is assumed that the reader is familiar with anova and regression-type statistical models.},

abstract = {The seaweed Fucus serratus is hypothesized to have evolved in the North Atlantic and present populations are thought to reflect recolonization from a southern refugium since the last glacial maximum 18 000â20 000 years BP. We examined genetic structure across several spatial scales by analysing seven microsatellite loci in populations collected from 21 localities throughout the species' range. Spatial auto-correlation analysis of seven microsatellite loci revealed no evidence for spatial clustering of alleles on a scale of 100 m despite limited gamete dispersal in F. serratus of â 2 m from parental individuals. Pairwise $\theta$ analysis suggested that the minimal panmictic unit for F. serratus was between 0.5 and 2 km. Isolation by distance was significant along some contiguous coastlines. Population differentiation was strong within the SkagerrakâKattegatâBaltic Seas (SKB) (global $\theta$ = 0.17) despite a short history of â 7500 years. A neighbour-joining tree based on Reynold's distances computed from the microsatellite data revealed a central assemblage of populations on the Brittany Peninsula surrounded by four well-supported clusters consisting of the SKB, the North Sea (Ireland, Helgoland), and two populations from the northern Spanish coast. Samples from Iceland and Nova Scotia were most closely aligned with northwest Sweden and Brittany, respectively. When sample sizes were standardized (N = 41), allelic diversity was twofold higher for Brittany populations than for populations to the north and threefold higher than southern populations. The Brittany region may be a refugium or a recolonized area, whereas the Spanish populations most likely reflect present-day edge populations that have undergone repeated bottlenecks as a consequence of thermally induced cycles of recolonization and extinction.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Many marine organisms are sedentary as adults and are redistributed between generations by the oceanic transport of planktonic larvae. In order to assess interactions among oceanographic and biological processes that determine larval dispersal patterns, we introduce a Lagrangian (or water-parcel-following) description of larval transport. This formalism is used to determine larval dispersal kernels (larval settlement probability distributions) for a range of ocean flows, planktonic larval durations and settlement pre-competency/competency periods. Paths of individual planktonic larval releases are modeled statistically and, by averaging over many individuals, ensemble estimates of larval dispersal are determined. Typical dispersal scales vary from a few km to {\textgreater}400 km. Modeled dispersal kernels are well explained using only a few readily available biological and oceanographic parameters, and derived dispersal scales agree well with population-genetic estimates, suggesting that the model has reasonable predictive power. An index for regional-scale self-seeding is presented, and is used as a tool to evaluate the efficiency of marine conservation areas. Finally, settlement patterns resulting from larval releases made over short times (days to months) should be comprised of a small number of discrete samples taken from the long-term averaged dispersal kernel. The resulting larval dispersal patterns will be quasi-random in both space and time, which will have important implications for the interpretation of settlement time series and the prediction of recruitment of sessile organisms.},

abstract = {Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Approximately 60{\%} of adults are CMV seropositive, indicating previous exposure. Following resolution of the primary infection, CMV remains in a latent state. Reactivation is controlled by memory T cells in healthy individuals; transplant recipients have reduced memory T cell function due to chronic immunosuppressive therapies. In this study, CD8(+) T cell responses to CMV polypeptides immediate-early-1 and pp65 were analyzed in 16 CMV-seropositive kidney and heart transplant recipients longitudinally pretransplantation and posttransplantation. All patients received standard of care maintenance immunosuppression, antiviral prophylaxis, and CMV viral load monitoring, with approximately half receiving T cell-depleting induction therapy. The frequency of CMV-responsive CD8(+) T cells, defined by the production of effector molecules in response to CMV peptides, increased during the course of 1 year posttransplantation. The increase commenced after the completion of antiviral prophylaxis, and these T cells tended to be terminally differentiated effector cells. Based on this small cohort, these data suggest that even in the absence of disease, antigenic exposure may continually shape the CMV-responsive T cell population posttransplantation.},

abstract = {Acceptance of marine protected areas (MPAs) as fishery and conservation tools has been hampered by lack of direct evidence that MPAs successfully seed unprotected areas with larvae of targeted species. For the first time, we present direct evidence of large-scale population connectivity within an existing and effective network of MPAs. A new parentage analysis identified four parent-offspring pairs from a large, exploited population of the coral-reef fish Zebrasoma flavescens in Hawai'i, revealing larval dispersal distances ranging from 15 to 184 km. In two cases, successful dispersal was from an MPA to unprotected sites. Given high adult abundances, the documentation of any parent-offspring pairs demonstrates that ecologically-relevant larval connectivity between reefs is substantial. All offspring settled at sites to the north of where they were spawned. Satellite altimetry and oceanographic models from relevant time periods indicated a cyclonic eddy that created prevailing northward currents between sites where parents and offspring were found. These findings empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MPAs as useful conservation and management tools and further highlight the importance of coupling oceanographic, genetic, and ecological data to predict, validate and quantify larval connectivity among marine populations.},

abstract = {This three year field investigation consisted of three discrete experiments, examining six potential sites for rearing the European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) around the Cornish coast (U.K.). Sea-based container culture (SBCC) systems were deployed, varying site, year, depth, shelter and pre-fouling, to test effects on growth and survival of juvenile H. gammarus. Site and depth were examined between May-August 2011 at two sites off the South coast. One estuarine (River Fal: RF) and one sea-based (St. Austell Bay: SA) site were assessed with containers suspended at either 2 or 8 m depth. Greatest survival was found at the SA site (56{\%}) compared to RF (25{\%}), with the greatest growth (specific growth rate: SGR 3{\%}, live weight gain: LWG 0.4. g and carapace length gain: CLG 4.5 mm) also achieved at SA. Depth did not affect juvenile development. Between May and August 2012, one estuarine (Fowey: F) and two sea-based (SA and St. Mawes: SM) sites on the south coast were selected to assess the effect of site and shelter. SM showed the highest survival (93{\%}). Growth and survival were not affected by the presence of a shelter. From August to December 2013, three sites off the north and south coasts were selected to assess the effect of site, depth, pre-fouling and feed availability. Sea-based (Port Quin Bay: PQ, Wave Hub: WH and SA) sites were assessed, with containers submerged at either 3 or 10 m above the sea bed (PQ 7-14 m, WH 42-49 m depth at chart datum). Survival did not significantly differ between sites (61-86{\%}), but growth at the PQ site (LWG 0.7 g; carapace length gain: CLG 6.1 mm) was significantly greater than at all other sites (LWG 0.3-0.4 g; CLG 2.5-3.6 mm). Depth did not affect juvenile development. Pre-fouling reduced growth at all sites. Feed availability varied between sites with PQ showing the greatest taxonomical units. Variations between years were also shown between 2011 and 2013 at the SA site. SBCC systems show potential for culturing H. gammarus juveniles compared to hatchery controls (survival â¤ 46{\%}), acting as a transition step between hatchery rearing and release for stocking purposes. The importance of site selection and between year variations is highlighted as important factors to consider for larger scale assessment of aquaculture potential. Statement of relevance: This work presents the culmination of three discrete studies between 2011 and 2013 that investigated the use of sea based container culture (SBCC) systems for rearing European lobster (H. gammarus) juveniles at various sites around South West England. This is a relatively novel field and the first study of its kind to consider sites around the South West of England and also to quantitatively assess potential feed species. The main findings of this work identify the importance of site selection, deployment and container structure. With an ever increasing demand for protein, there needs to be efforts to relieve pressure on natural fishing stocks. This study not only highlights the potential for SBCC to provide improved stock enhancement processes but also discusses the potential for aquaculture of this currently unexploited species.Juvenile culture is one of the bottlenecks for the development of lobster culture due to high unit cost of production, high mortality rates due to cannibalism within intensive culture systems and long development times, and as such we feel that this work is extremely timely and relevant. This manuscript will not only contribute to the understanding of how SBCC systems can be employed, but also adds to our understanding of the requirements of the species. Therefore, this work is of significant interest to those involved in the culture of lobsters and marine animals generally.},

abstract = {The presented work describes the hydrodynamic assessment studies of a much needed technical innovation of Sea Based Container Culture (SBCC) as part of a semi-intensive, passive aquaculture culture system for farming the European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}). Factors that are known to influence growth and survival rates were obtained from previous literature, including flow rate, wave energy and motion characteristics; these factors defined performance criteria for SBCC containers. The internal flow velocities and external flow patterns for different SBCC container designs were measured and used to inform design decisions. Suitable graphical representations have been developed to assess SBCC containers on specific performance criteria. Oyster SBCC containers were found to provide stable motion characteristics but perform poorly against the lower velocity limit, indicating insufficient supply of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) to allow for optimal growth of European lobsters. Internal flow velocities were also measured on un-fouled and fouled SBCC containers; results showed SBCC 2 would not provide enough DO with 66{\%} biofouling coverage (66{\%} biofouling replicates one year deployment) and triggered a redesign. SBCC 1 at 90Â° yaw angle of attack demonstrated all round good performance against upper and lower velocity limits and motion characteristics; thus showed greatest promise for cultivation of European Lobster.},

Larvae were reared in green water culture for 12days from hatch until metamorphosis to zoea III. Un-supplemented Artemia nauplii (control) or Artemia nauplii enriched with probiotics (Bacillus spp. 100mgl-1), prebiotic (MOS 12mgl-1) or synbiotics (100mgl-1Bacillus spp.+MOS 12mgl-1) were each fed to 3 replicate groups of zoea I lobsters for 12days. The effects on gut microbiota were assessed using culture-dependent methods at 1, 7 and 12days post-hatch (dph) and PCR-DGGE at 1 and 12dph. PCR-DGGE was also used to assess microbial communities of the live feeds. Carapace length and weight of five H. gammarus from each replicate was recorded on 1, 7, and 12dph and survival to zoea III was recorded. A low salinity stress test was used as a measure of organism fitness at day 12.After 12. dph, H. gammarus larvae fed experimental treatments had significantly (P{\textless}. 0.02) improved weight, carapace length and weight gain, compared to larvae fed control treatments. Survival to 12. dph was elevated by all treatments and was significantly (P{\textless}. 0.001) increased for the Bacillus and MOS fed larvae. Salinity stress tolerance was greatest in larvae fed Bacillus although all experimental treatments produced enhanced tolerance to salinity stress in comparison to larvae fed control treatment. Culture-dependent analysis of the gut microbiota of larval lobsters demonstrated the colonisation of Bacillus spp. in larvae fed probiotic or synbiotic enriched live feeds. There was also a reduction in Vibrio levels in certain biotic fed larvae and live feed treatments. PCR-DGGE revealed that the number of observed taxonomical units (OTUs), species richness and species diversity increased in zoea III lobsters fed probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic. Subsequently, the microbial profiles were dissimilar to the control group with the synbiotic group showing the greatest dissimilarity to the control (36.54. Â±. 2.54{\%}). The similarity between bacterial communities associated with Artemia and zoea III larvae was highest in the Bacillus treatments (53.86{\%}). The present study demonstrates the benefit of applying dietary supplementation of Bacillus, MOS and Bacillus+. MOS on the GI microbiota of lobster larvae which subsequently improved growth performance and stress tolerance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon teach Alice a dance in which everyone partners with a lobster and then throws it âas far out to sea as you canâ (1). While the âporpoiseâ (as the Mock Turtle pronounces âpurposeâ) of throwing lobsters never becomes entirely clear in the story, Le Bris et al. (2) show in PNAS that the century-old practice of returning large and female lobsters back to the waters of Maine has primed the fishery to thrive in the face of climate change (Fig. 1). Their contribution provides key insight that can guide more widespread climate adaptation in fisheries.Fig. 1. Illustration of how conservation of large female lobsters may have prepared the Gulf of Maine fishery to flourish as environmental conditions changed. Large females contribute disproportionately to the production of young lobsters and allowed the population to grow more rapidly in favorable conditions (A) than it would have if large females were also harvested in lobster traps (B). Most fisheries only use a minimum size limit, as did the southern New England lobster fishery for many years. However, other mechanisms, including differences in thermal conditions, predators, and disease burden, also contribute to explain the contrasting trajectories of Maine and southern New England lobster populations.Climate change has already reshuffled ecosystems globally, and past and ongoing emissions will continue to drive substantial warming and other environmental changes over the next few decades. One of the challenging questions is therefore whether and how to adapt human activities across a wide range of sectors, from agriculture to water supply, air travel, and coastal development. Fish are the most highly traded food commodity and the largest human food source based on wild species, so fisheries provide a particularly interesting and challenging sector in which to consider {\ldots} âµ1Email: malin.pinsky{\{}at{\}}rutgers.edu.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The authors. The European lobster \textit{Homarus gammarus} is heavily exploited in the Norwegian fishery, and several management actions have been implemented to protect the species. Three marine protected areas (MPAs) excluding all but hook and line type fishing gear were established along the Skagerrak coast in 2006, effectively banning the trap-based fishery for European lobster. Lobster populations within MPAs and adjacent control areas were studied by capture-mark-recapture and recovery methods every year from prior to MPA establishment to the present. During 2006-2014, a total of 4682 and 3317 lobsters were captured (including recaptures) in the MPAs and control areas, respectively. In all MPAs, protection led to a shift in demography, with an increase in  mean total length of 15{\%} during 2006-2014, thereby opposing the effects of a size-selective fishery. No difference was found in rates of movement out from MPAs and control areas, but lobsters moving from MPAs and caught in fished areas were significantly larger than lobsters moving out of control areas. In instances where lobsters tagged in a control area moved into an MPA, the immigrating lobsters had a larger body size than the mean in their area of origin. The range of movement undertaken by recovered lobsters extended beyond the home range sizes suggested by previous shorter-term studies, and well beyond the sizes of the small coastal MPAs studied herein. In summary, demographic changes should be accounted for when interpreting the value of spillover from MPAs, and also potential âspill in' from fished areas to MPAs.},

abstract = {A series of experiments was conducted to test if keeping hatchery-produced European lobster juveniles (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) in an enriched environment with substrate and shelter would improve anti-predator behaviour and survival in a competition setting. Newly hatched postlarvae (stage IV) were divided into two treatments. Na{\"{i}}ve postlarvae were raised in single compartments, while trained postlarvae were released communally into tanks with substrate and shelter, allowing for developing burrowing and shelter-seeking behaviour and interactions with conspecifics. The duration of the treatment lasted 181Â days in 2007/2008 and 226Â days in 2008/2009. In the second experiment, 4-mo old juveniles were purchased from a commercial hatchery and divided into the same two treatment groups. The treatments were considerably shorter, lasting 47Â days. At the end of the treatment period an equal number of juveniles from each treatment was released into experimental units with substrate and shelter i.e. semi-natural system for a period of 91â145Â days. Number of shelters was half the total number of juveniles to induce competition for shelters. In both experiments, trained juveniles occupied more shelters and had higher survival than na{\"{i}}ve juveniles. Combining all experiments, average survival was 53{\%} in trained lobsters compared with 18{\%} in the na{\"{i}}ve lobsters. These results are the first to demonstrate that enriching the hatchery environment for a period of time (a minimum of 47Â days here) while rearing European lobster juveniles increased their shelter occupancy and their survival compared to na{\"{i}}ve juveniles the same size and age. Survival rates were 3â4 times higher in trained compared to na{\"{i}}ve lobsters after 145Â days.},

abstract = {Monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of no-take zones (NTZs) is critical, not just for the effective management of marine resources, but also for informing and gaining support from community stakeholders. The Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) established a network of coastal NTZs in 2001, yet, to date no study has investigated their effectiveness in protecting and enabling key species to recover. Using data from the Galapagos National Park Directorate annual Lobster Population Monitoring Program from 2012 to 2014, this study evaluated the recovery of the commercially valuable red spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus) inside NTZs in the GMR. It was hypothesized that NTZs would present higher lobster abundances or sizes when compared with adjacent fished zones. However, the study found no significant differences in these comparisons. Overall the findings indicate that {\textgreater} 11 years of protection has had no appreciable effect on lobster abundances or sizes inside the NTZs. This paper explores possible reasons for the lack of response in NTZs, and concluded that non-compliance and shortcomings within the enforcement framework of the GMR are the key factors limiting the functionality of these NTZs. Additionally, it also evaluates the limitations of the current monitoring program and highlights the need for a more comprehensive and long-term program to be implemented. As the new zoning scheme for NTZs in the GMR that began in 2016 is still to be determined, this information should be considered by decision makers to improve the effectiveness of NTZs and sustainable management of the GRM's coastal resources.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged â¥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Removing individuals from a wild population can affect the availability of prospective mates and the outcome of competitive interactions, with subsequent effects on mating patterns and sexual selection. Consequently, the rate of harvest-induced evolution is predicted to be strongly dependent on the strength and dynamics of sexual selection yet, there is limited empirical knowledge on the interplay between selective harvesting and the mating systems of exploited species. In this study, we used genetic parentage assignment to compare mating patterns of the highly valued and overexploited European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) in a designated lobster reserve and nearby fished area in Southern Norway. In the area open to fishing, the fishery is regulated by a closed season, a minimum legal size and a ban on the harvest of egg-bearing females. Due to the differences in size and sex- specific fishing mortality between the two areas, males and females are of approximately equal average size in the fished area, whereas males tend to be larger in the reserve. Our results show that females would mate with males larger than their own body size, but the relative size difference was significantly larger in the reserve. Sexual selection acted positively on both body size and claw size in males in the reserve, while it was non-significant in fished areas. This strongly suggests that size truncation of males by fishing reduces the variability of traits that sexual selection acts upon. If fisheries continue to target large individuals (particularly males) with higher relative reproductive success, the weakening of sexual selection will likely accelerate fisheries-induced evolution towards smaller body size},

abstract = {Abstract Inbreeding and relationship metrics among and within populations are useful measures for genetic management of wild populations, but accuracy and precision of estimates can be influenced by the number of individual genotypes analysed. Biologists are confronted with varied advice regarding the sample size necessary for reliable estimates when using genomic tools. We developed a simulation framework to identify the optimal sample size for three widely used metrics to enable quantification of expected variance and relative bias of estimates and a comparison of results among populations. We applied this approach to analyse empirical genomic data for 30 individuals from each of four different free?ranging Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) populations in Montana and Wyoming, USA, through cross?species application of an Ovine array and analysis of approximately 14,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after filtering. We examined intra? and interpopulation relationships using kinship and identity by state metrics, as well as FST between populations. By evaluating our simulation results, we concluded that a sample size of 25 was adequate for assessing these metrics using the Ovine array to genotype Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep herds. However, we conclude that a universal sample size rule may not be able to sufficiently address the complexities that impact genomic kinship and inbreeding estimates. Thus, we recommend that a pilot study and sample size simulation using R code we developed that includes empirical genotypes from a subset of populations of interest would be an effective approach to ensure rigour in estimating genomic kinship and population differentiation.},

abstract = {Tests for isolation by distance (IBD) are the most commonly used method of assessing spatial genetic structure. Many studies have exclusively used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to test for IBD, but this marker is often in conflict with multilocus markers. Here, we report a review of the literature on IBD, with the aims of determining (a) whether significant IBD is primarily a result of lumping spatially discrete populations, and (b) whether microsatellite datasets are more likely to detect IBD when mtDNA does not. We also provide empirical data from four species in which mtDNA failed to detect IBD by comparing these with microsatellite and SNP data. Our results confirm that IBD is mostly found when distinct regional populations are pooled, and this trend disappears when each is analysed separately. Discrepancies between markers were found in almost half of the studies reviewed, and microsatellites were more likely to detect IBD when mtDNA did not. Our empirical data rejected the lack of IBD in the four species studied, and support for IBD was particularly strong for the SNP data. We conclude that mtDNA sequence data are often not suitable to test for IBD, and can be misleading about species' true dispersal potential. The observed failure of mtDNA to reliably detect IBD, in addition to being a single-locus marker, is likely a result of a selection-driven reduction in genetic diversity obscuring spatial genetic differentiation. Species with wide distributions are rarely completely panmictic 1 , even in potentially open systems such as the world's oceans 2,3 . When individual dispersal distances are smaller than a species' range, genetic drift acting on neutral genetic markers will over time result in a positive correlation between genetic differentiation between locations and the geographic distance separating them, a pattern known as " isolation by distance " (IBD) 4,5 . IBD is currently the most frequently tested hypothesis in studies of spatial genetic structure, and is considered to provide a suitable means of indirectly estimating a species' dispersal ability 6,7 . The method is also considered important in the management of exploited species. For example, in high-dispersal marine species in which the existence of clear stock boundaries is unlikely, tests for IBD can help to define regional geographic units that respond to exploitation relatively independently 8 . Despite their popularity, tests for IBD are often criticised. One recent debate concerns the use of Mantel tests in assessing relationships between genetic and spatial data 9 . It has been suggested that the power of other approaches (e.g. linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis) is far greater than that of Mantel tests in detecting a relationship when one is present 10 . Another problem, and one that affects IBD per se rather than merely the way in which it is identified, concerns its use under inappropriate conditions. Most prevalently, IBD can be strongly affected by the existence of distinct regional genetic clusters 11 . For example, secondary contact between populations that have been isolated from each other in glacial refugia 12 or the existence of sister lineages in adjacent biogeographical regions 13 , will give the impression of limited dispersal ability even when each pop-ulation is genetically homogeneous within its range. The fact that some regional genetic clusters display physio-logical adaptations to the region they occupy, and some are morphologically distinguishable from each other 14,15},

abstract = {Populations of broadcast spawning marine organisms often have large sizes and are exposed to reduced genetic drift. Under such scenarios, strong selection associated with spatial environmental heterogeneity is expected to drive localized adaptive divergence, even in the face of connectivity. We tested this hypothesis using a seascape genomics approach in the commercially important greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). We assessed how its population structure has been influenced by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in southern Australia linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our datasets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and environmental mapping across {\~{}}800 km. Genotype-environment association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation (global FST =0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a stepping stone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however, model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance, including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found in other biogeographic regions. Our study includes a documented example about the uptake of genomic information in fisheries management and supports the hypothesis of adaptive divergence due to coastal environmental heterogeneity in a connected metapopulation of a broadcast spawner.

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are major tools to protect biodiversity and sustain fisheries. For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of MPA networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between MPAs remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred MPAs. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean MPAs are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each MPA was directly connected to four others and MPAs were clustered into several groups. Two MPAs (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of MPA distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20{\%} of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected MPAs providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more.},

abstract = {A marine protected area (MPA) is an area of the ocean designated for the conservation and protection of natural or cultural resources. MPAs are spatial tools used to preserve the ecological integrity and biodiversity of an area, protecting ecosystem functions, species and habitats for future generations. In 2015, the Canadian government committed to increasing protection of its coastal and marine areas up to 10{\%} by 2020. To reach this goal, the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) is currently in the process of designing and implementing a network of MPAs in the Maritimes Region, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. The design process needs to consider population connectivity, which in turn requires an understanding of life-histories for target species (i.e. the movement of adults and the dispersal of larval life-stages). The population parameters that repeatedly emerge as necessary for deriving estimates of MPA dimensions include the spatial distribution of the conservation priority (species or habitat), movement patterns and oceanographic processes. A decision tree was developed that uses information on species larval dispersal, and juvenile, and adult movement to provide guidelines that can inform definition of size and spacing of individual MPAs in a network. Case studies of species targeted for protection on the Scotian Shelf are presented, to illustrate its use. The decision tree can be used as a tool to help design networks that ensure population connectivity where there is a paucity of biological information, or as a quality control method for assessing other spatial design tools.},

abstract = {Rapid environmental change makes adaptive potential-the capacity of populations to evolve genetically based changes in response to selection-more important than ever for long-term persistence of at-risk species. At the same time, advances in genomics provide unprecedented power to test for and quantify adaptive potential, enabling consideration of adaptive potential in estimates of extinction risk and laws protecting endangered species. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is one of the most powerful environmental laws in the world, but so far, the full potential of genomics in ESA listing and recovery decisions has not been realized by the federal agencies responsible for implementing the ESA or by conservation geneticists. The goal of our paper is to chart a path forward for integrating genomics into ESA decision making to facilitate full consideration of adaptive potential in evaluating long-term risk of extinction. For policy makers, managers, and other conservation practitioners, we outline why adaptive potential is important for population persistence and what genomic tools are available for quantifying it. For conservation geneticists, we discuss how federal agencies can integrate information on the effect of adaptive potential on extinction risk-and the related uncertainty-into decisions, and suggest next steps for advancing understanding of the effect of adaptive potential on extinction risk. The mechanisms and consequences of adaptation are incredibly complex, and we may never have a complete understanding of adaptive potential for any organism. Nevertheless, we argue that the best available evidence regarding adaptive potential can now be incorporated by federal agencies into modeling and decision making processes, while at the same time conserving genome-wide variation and striving for a deeper understanding of adaptive potential and its effects on population persistence to improve decision making into the future.},

abstract = {Connectivity is frequently cited as a vital component of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks and was formally identified as one of five key principles for marine network design in European waters. Yet, without the ability to demonstrate connectivity, it is impossible to be certain that sites designated within a MPA network do in fact constitute a network, when they may âirrespective of the diversity and rarity of the taxa within themâ be in reality a set of unlinked habitats and associated species assemblages. However, the process of assessing connectivity between MPAs, and which taxa to include in assessments of connectivity, is often difficult and can be dependent on a variety of factors that can be outside the control of managers, stakeholders and policymakers. Among the many methods that have been used to assess connectivity, genetic markers are often used to infer connectivity indirectly by estimating the degree of genetic differentiation between populations of a species or by inferring the origin(s) of migrants using assignment methods. While modern molecular methods can be extremely robust and are now routinely used to address conservation issues, genetic data are, to the authors' knowledge, rarely used to inform designation of MPA networks. In this paper, several biological and methodological factors are highlighted, consideration of which may help to inform the selection of species for assessments of connectivity between MPAs in a network, and this paper suggests ways in which genetic data may be interpreted to inform MPA design and policy.},

abstract = {A key quantity in the analysis of structured populations is the parameter K, which describes the number of subpopulations that make up the total population. Inference of K ideally proceeds via the model evidence, which is equivalent to the likelihood of the model. However, the evidence in favour of a particular value of K cannot usually be computed exactly, and instead programs such as STRUCTURE make use of heuristic estimators to approximate this quantity. We show - using simulated data sets small enough that the true evidence can be computed exactly - that these heuristics often fail to estimate the true evidence, and that this can lead to incorrect conclusions about K. Our proposed solution is to use thermodynamic integration (TI) to estimate the model evidence. After outlining the TI methodology we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a range of simulated data sets. We find that TI can be used to obtain estimates of the model evidence that are more accurate and precise than those based on heuristics. Furthermore, estimates of K based on these values are found to be more reliable than those based on a suite of model comparison statistics. Finally, we test our solution in a reanalysis of a white-footed mouse data set. The TI methodology is implemented for models both with and without admixture in the software MAVERICK1.0.},

abstract = {Knowledge of larval dispersal, population dynamics and connectivity in relation to the management and conservation of commercially important species is vital if existing fisheries are to remain sustainable into the future. Larval dispersal of the commercially exploited spiny lobster, Palinurus elephas, was modelled from Marine Protected Areas located in the southwest of England for a 16-month period using a General Individuals Transport Model (GITM). The model included physical particle advection based on current fields from a 3D hydrodynamics model and a larval behaviour module. Our results demonstrate the overall dispersal patterns of P. elephas larvae and highlight populations capable of self-seeding and those which are seemingly reliant on larvae from more distant populations. The results indicate where further research may be required to fully understand how populations of P. elephas are maintained at regional, national and international scales while providing us with the opportunity to discuss the effectiveness of current approaches to conservation and fisheries management.},

abstract = {Glacial and postglacial processes are known to be important determinants of contemporary population structuring for many species. In Europe, refugia in the Italian, Balkan and Iberian peninsulas are believed to be the main sources of species colonising northern Europe after the glacial retreat; however, there is increasing evidence of small, cryptic refugia existing north of these for many cold-tolerant species. This study examined the glacial history of Atlantic salmon in western Europe using two independent classes of molecular markers, microsatellites (nuclear) and mitochondrial DNA variation. Alongside the well-documented refuge in the Iberian Peninsula, evidence for a cryptic refuge in northwest France is also presented. Critically, methods utilised to estimate divergence times between the refugia indicated that salmon in these two regions had diverged a long time before the last glacial maximum; coalescence analysis (as implemented in the program IMa2) estimated divergence times at around 60 000 years before present. Through the examination of haplotype frequencies, previously glaciated areas of northwest Europe, that is, Britain and Ireland, appear to have been colonised from salmon expanding out of both refugia, with the southwest of England being the primary contact zone and exhibiting the highest genetic diversity.},

abstract = {The duration of the larval phase of the American lobster influences the distance larvae drift, and thus the potential settlement and recruitment patterns of lobsters to local populations and fisheries. The duration of larval stages is influenced by temperature, with warmer temperatures resulting in faster development and shorter stage duration. The quantitative relationship between temperature and duration of larval stages has been previously investigated, but only for lobsters originating from relatively warm-water regions. We examined the effects of temperature on stage duration for lobster larvae originating from a cold-water region, the northern shore of the Gaspe Peninsula in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. We reared larvae individually using a new experimental apparatus with automated movement of culture containers to facilitate water exchange. We compared observed duration of larval stages for these cold-water source larvae to durations in previous studies that used warmer-water source larvae. We observed 38{\%} shorter development times at the coldest temperature used (10 degrees C) and 47, 50, and 100{\%} longer development times at warmer temperatures (14, 18 and 22 degrees C, respectively) than at the same temperatures in previous studies of warm-water larvae, suggesting potential geographic variation in the functional relationship between temperature and larval development time. Given these results, future research should examine this question in more detail, to enhance understanding of lobster ecology and population dynamics across the species' range.},

Deserts, even those at tropical latitudes, often have strikingly low levels of plant diversity, particularly within genera. One remarkable exception to this pattern is the genus Petalidium (Acanthaceae), in which 37 of 40 named species occupy one of the driest environments on Earth, the Namib Desert of Namibia and neighboring Angola. To contribute to understanding this enigmatic diversity, we generated RADseq data for 47 accessions of Petalidium representing 22 species. We explored the impacts of 18 different combinations of assembly parameters in de novo assembly of the data across nine levels of missing data plus a best practice assembly using a reference Acanthaceae genome for a total of 171 sequence datasets assembled. RADseq data assembled at several thresholds of missing data, including 90{\%} missing data, yielded phylogenetic hypotheses of Petalidium that were confidently and nearly fully resolved, which is notable given that divergence time analyses suggest a crown age for African species of 3.6â1.4Â Ma. De novo assembly of our data yielded the most strongly supported and well-resolved topologies; in contrast, reference-based assembly performed poorly, perhaps due in part to moderate phylogenetic divergence between the reference genome, Ruellia speciosa, and the ingroup. Overall, we found that Petalidium, despite the harshness of the environment in which species occur, shows a net diversification rate (0.8â2.1 species per my) on par with those of diverse genera in tropical, Mediterranean, and alpine environments.},

abstract = {Whole genome duplications have occurred in the recent ancestors of many plants, fish, and amphibians, resulting in a pervasiveness of paralogous loci and the potential for both disomic and tetrasomic inheritance in the same genome. Paralogs can be difficult to reliably genotype and are often excluded from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) analyses; however, removal requires paralogs to be identified which is difficult without a reference genome. We present a method for identifying paralogs in natural populations by combining two properties of duplicated loci: 1) the expected frequency of heterozygotes exceeds that for singleton loci, and 2) within heterozygotes, observed read ratios for each allele in GBS data will deviate from the 1:1 expected for singleton (diploid) loci. These deviations are often not apparent within individuals, particularly when sequence coverage is low; but, we postulated that summing allele reads for each locus over all heterozygous individuals in a population would provide sufficient power to detect deviations at those loci. We identified paralogous loci in three species: Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) which retains regions with ongoing residual tetrasomy on eight chromosome arms following a recent whole genome duplication, mountain barberry (Berberis alpina) which has a large proportion of paralogs that arose through an unknown mechanism, and dusky parrotfish (Scarus niger) which has largely re-diploidized following an ancient whole genome duplication. Importantly, this approach only requires the genotype and allele-specific read counts for each individual, information which is readily obtained from most GBS analysis pipelines.

In particular, knowledge about their connectivity, potential adaptation and resilience are needed. This information can be obtained through the analysis of genome-wide markers which are now relatively easily and cost-efficiently discovered thanks to high-throughput sequencing technologies.

Exclusion of this locus reconciles the results from the SNP and the microsatellite datasets.

abstract = {Genetic structure in many widely-distributed broadcast spawning marine invertebrates remains poorly understood, posing substantial challenges for their fishery management, conservation and aquaculture. Under the Core-Periphery Hypothesis (CPH), genetic diversity is expected to be highest at the centre of a species' distribution, progressively decreasing with increased differentiation towards outer range limits, as populations become increasingly isolated, fragmented and locally adapted. The unique life history characteristics of many marine invertebrates such as high dispersal rates, stochastic survival and variable recruitment are also likely to influence how populations are organised. To examine the microevolutionary forces influencing population structure, connectivity and adaptive variation in a highly-dispersive bivalve, populations of the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera were examined across its {\~{}}18,000 km Indo-Pacific distribution. Analyses utilising 9,624 genome-wide SNPs and 580 oysters, discovered differing patterns of significant and substantial broad-scale genetic structure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins. Indian Ocean populations were markedly divergent (F st = 0.2534â0.4177, p {\textless} 0.001), compared to Pacific Ocean oysters, where basin-wide gene flow was much higher (F st = 0.0007â0.1090, p {\textless} 0.001). Partitioning of genetic diversity (hierarchical AMOVA) attributed 18.1{\%} of variance between ocean basins, whereas greater proportions were resolved within samples and populations (45.8{\%} and 35.7{\%} respectively). Visualisation of population structure at selectively neutral loci resolved three and five discrete genetic clusters for the Indian and Pacific Oceans respectively. Evaluation of genetic structure at adaptive loci for Pacific populations (89 SNPs under directional selection; F st = 0.1012â0.4371, FDR = 0.05), revealed five clusters identical to those detected at neutral SNPs, suggesting environmental heterogeneity within the Pacific. Patterns of structure and connectivity were supported by Mantel tests of isolation by distance (IBD) and independent hydrodynamic particle dispersal simulations. It is evident that genetic structure and connectivity across the natural range of P. margaritifera is highly complex, and produced by the interaction of ocean currents, IBD and seascape features at a broad scale, together with habitat geomorphology and local adaptation at regional levels. Overall population organisation is far more elaborate than generalised CPH predictions, however valuable insights for regional fishery management, and a greater understanding of range-wide genetic structure in a highly-dispersive marine invertebrate have been gained.},

abstract = {Environmental factors can influence diversity and population structure in marine species and accurate understanding of this influence can both improve fisheries management and help predict responses to environmental change. We used 7163 SNPs derived from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyped in 245 individuals of the economically important sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, to evaluate the correlations between oceanographic variation and a previously identified latitudinal genomic cline. Sea scallops span a broad latitudinal area ({\textgreater}10 degrees), and we hypothesized that climatic variation significantly drives clinal trends in allele frequency. Using a large environmental dataset, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and nutrient concentrations, we identified a suite of SNPs (285-621, depending on analysis and environmental dataset) potentially under selection through correlations with environmental variation. Principal components analysis of different outlier SNPs and environmental datasets revealed similar northern and southern clusters, with significant associations between the first axes of each (R2adjÂ =Â .66-.79). Multivariate redundancy analysis of outlier SNPs and the environmental principal components indicated that environmental factors explained more than 32{\%} of the variance. Similarly, multiple linear regressions and random-forest analysis identified winter average and minimum ocean temperatures as significant parameters in the link between genetic and environmental variation. This work indicates that oceanographic variation is associated with the observed genomic cline in this species and that seasonal periods of extreme cold may restrict gene flow along a latitudinal gradient in this marine benthic bivalve. Incorporating this finding into management may improve accuracy of management strategies and future predictions.},

Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and other reduced-representation DNA sequencing (RRS) protocols (e.g., RADseq, ddRAD) have enabled the analysis of genetic data on an unprecedented scale. Here, we present a novel approach for the discovery and statistical validation of sex-specific loci in GBS data sets. We used GBS to genotype 166 New Zealand fur seals (NZFS, Arctocephalus forsteri) of known sex. We retained monomorphic loci as potential sex-specific markers in the locus discovery phase. We then used (i) a sex-specific locus threshold (SSLT) to identify significantly male-specific loci within our data set; and (ii) a significant sex-assignment threshold (SSAT) to confidently assign sex in silico the presence or absence of significantly male-specific loci to individuals in our data set treated as unknowns (98.9{\%} accuracy for females; 95.8{\%} for males, estimated via cross-validation). Furthermore, we assigned sex to 86 individuals of true unknown sex using our SSAT and assessed the effect of SSLT adjustments on these assignments. From 90 verified sex-specific loci, we developed a panel of three sex-specific PCR primers that we used to ascertain sex independently of our GBS data, which we show amplify reliably in at least two other pinniped species. Using monomorphic loci normally discarded from large SNP data sets is an effective way to identify robust sex-linked markers for nonmodel species.

abstract = {Understanding patterns of dispersal and connectivity among marine populations can directly inform fisheries conservation and management. Advances in high-throughput sequencing offer new opportunities for estimating marine connectivity. We used Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing to examine dispersal and realized connectivity in the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus, an economically important marine bivalve. Based on 245 individuals sampled range-wide at 12 locations from Newfoundland to the Mid-Atlantic Bight we identified and genotyped 7163 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms; 112 (1.6{\%}) were identified as outliers potentially under directional selection. Bayesian clustering revealed a discontinuity between northern and southern samples and latitudinal clines in allele frequencies were observed in 42.9{\%} of the outlier loci and in 24.6{\%} of neutral loci. Dispersal estimates derived using these clines and estimates of linkage disequilibrium imply limited dispersal; 373.1 Â± 407.0 km (mean Â± SD) for outlier loci and 641.0 Â± 544.6 km (mean Â± SD) for neutral loci. Our analysis suggests restricted dispersal compared to the species range ({\textgreater}2000 km) and that dispersal and effective connectivity differ. These observations support the hypothesis that limited effective dispersal structures scallop populations along eastern North America. These findings can help refine the appropriate scale of management and conservation in this commercially valuable species.},

abstract = {In spite of the long-term interest in the process of balancing selection, its frequency in genomes and evolutionary significance remain unclear due to challenges related to its detection. Current statistical approaches based on patterns of variation observed in molecular data suffer from low power and a high incidence of false-positives. This raises the question whether balancing selection is rare or is simply difficult to detect. We discuss genetic signatures produced by this mode of selection, and review the current approaches used for their identification in genomes. Advantages and disadvantages of the available methods are presented and areas where improvement is possible are identified. Increased specificity and reduced rate of false-positives may be achieved by using an appropriate demographic model, applying combinations of tests, appropriate sampling scheme and taking into account intralocus variation in selection pressures. We emphasize novel solutions, recently developed model-based approaches and good practices that should be implemented in future studies looking for signals of balancing selection. We also draw attention of the readers to the results of recent theoretical studies which suggest that balancing selection may be ubiquitous but transient, leaving few signatures detectable by existing methods. Testing this new theory may require the development of novel high-throughput methods extending beyond genomic scans. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Natural selection shapes patterns of genetic variation among individuals, populations, and species, and it does so differentially across genomes. The field of population genomics provides a comprehensive genome-scale view of the action of selection, even beyond traditional model organisms. However, even with nearly complete genomic sequence information, our ability to detect the signature of selection on specific genomic regions depends on choosing experimental and analytical tools appropriate to the biological situation. For example, processes that occur at different timescales, such as sorting of standing genetic variation, mutation-selection balance, or fixed interspecific divergence, have different consequences for genomic patterns of variation. Inappropriate experimental or analytical approaches may fail to detect even strong selection or falsely identify a signature of selection. Here we outline the conceptual framework of population genomics, relate genomic patterns of variation to evolutionary processes, and identify major biological factors to be considered in studies of selection. As data-gathering technology continues to advance, our ability to understand selection in natural populations will be limited more by conceptual and analytical weaknesses than by the amount of molecular data. Our aim is to bring critical biological considerations to the fore in population genomics research and to spur the development and application of analytical tools appropriate to diverse biological systems.},

abstract = {Although FST is widely used as a measure of population structure, it has been criticized recently because of its dependency on within-population diversity. This dependency can lead to difficulties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, Fâ²ST and D. Fâ²ST is the normal FST standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (FST, Fâ²ST and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4Â years of Molecular Ecology. As with FST, unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and Fâ²ST. Here, we develop a new unbiased Fâ²ST estimator based on GST, which we call Gâ²â²ST. However, Fâ²ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either Fâ²ST or D. In most cases, Fâ²ST would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the influence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

abstract = {Connectivity among marine populations is critical for persistence of metapopulations, coping with climate change, and determining the geographic distribution of species. The influence of pelagic larval duration (PLD) on connectivity has been studied extensively, but relatively little is known about the influence of other biological parameters, such as the survival and behavior of larvae, and the fecundity of adults, on population connectivity. Furthermore, the interaction between the seascape (habitat structure and currents) and these biological parameters is unclear. We explore these interactions using a biophysical model of larval dispersal across the Indo-Pacific. We describe an approach that quantifies geographic patterns of connectivity from demographically relevant to evolutionarily significant levels across a range of species. We predict that at least 95{\%} of larval settlement occurs within 155 km of the source population and within 13 days irrespective of the species' life history, yet long-distant connections remain likely. Self-recruitment is primarily driven by the local oceanography, larval mortality, and the larval precompetency period, whereas broad-scale connectivity is strongly influenced by reproductive output (abundance and fecundity of adults) and the length of PLD. The networks we have created are geographically explicit models of marine connectivity that define dispersal corridors, barriers, and the emergent structure of marine populations. These models provide hypotheses for empirical testing.},

abstract = {Often in applied research, confidence intervals (CIs) are constructed or reported only for parameters selected after viewing the data. We show that such selected intervals fail to provide the assumed coverage probability. By generalizing the false discover), rate (FDR) approach from multiple testing to selected multiple CIs, we suggest the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) as a measure of interval coverage following selection. A general procedure is then introduced, offering FCR control at level q under any selection rule. The procedure constructs a marginal CI for each selected parameter, but instead of the confidence level 1 - q being used marginally, q is divided by the number of parameters considered and multiplied by the number selected. If we further use the FDR controlling testing procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg for selecting the parameters, the newly suggested procedure offers CIs that are dual to the testing procedure and are shown to be optimal in the independent case. Under the positive regression dependency condition of Benjamini and Yekutieli, the FCR is controlled for one-sided tests and CIs, as well as for a modification for two-sided testing. Results for general dependency are also given. Finally, using the equivalence of the CIs to testing, we prove that the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg offers directional FDR control as conjectured.},

Similarly, oceanographic models based on environmental data can simulate particle movements in ocean currents and make quantitative estimates ofÂ larval connections between populations possible [5-9]. However, these two powerful approaches have remained disconnected because no general models currently provide a means of directly comparing dispersal predictions with empirical genetic data (except, see [10]). In addition, previous genetic models have considered relatively simple dispersal scenarios that are often unrealistic for marine larvae [11-15], and recent landscape genetic models have yet to be applied in a marine context [16-20]. We have developedÂ a genetic model that uses connectivity estimates from oceanographic models to predict genetic patterns resulting from larval dispersal in a Caribbean coral. We then compare the predictions to empirical data for threatened staghorn corals. Our coupled oceanographic-genetic model predicts many of the patterns observed in this and other empirical datasets; such patterns include the isolation of the Bahamas and an east-west divergence near Puerto Rico [3, 21-23]. This new approach provides both a valuable tool for predicting genetic structure in marine populations and a means of explicitly testing these predictions with empirical data (FigureÂ 1). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To analyse the larval dispersal pathways and connectivity patterns among fishing grounds of the great scallop in the Celtic Sea and the English Channel, a particle tracking model was developed. The model combined a 3D physical circulation model that simulated currents and temperature fields and a scallop larval submodel that took into account a temperature-dependent planktonic larval duration and an active vertical swimming behaviour. Due to the lack of stock assessment at the regional scale, the location of the main fishing grounds was established by combining different sources (e.g. grey literature, unpublished scientific surveys, vessel monitoring data, fishermen) while the spawning biomass of each stock was estimated from landings data. Results indicated that each local stock could not be considered as a single independent management unit and that all stocks except that of the Bay of Brest were connected to neighbouring stocks, suggest-ing that the management should be defined in a metapopulation context. Three major groups of strongly interconnected stocks including two or three stocks exhibiting high retention and self-recruitment rates and some peripheral stocks with a low self-recruitment rate were de-fined: the North Brittany and Channel Islands, the eastern English Channel, and the SW of England. Our results were discussed in terms of the definition of management units in comparison with genetic and phenotypic data, and in terms of resource management in a transnational context.},

abstract = {In the absence of a historical baseline, long-term no-take marine reserves can provide a reference to the unfished condition in exploited species of limited mobility. This study documents the recovery of the lobster Palinurus elephas within a large Mediterranean no-take marine reserve (MR) and uses it as a baseline to assess stock status in exploited grounds in the region. Lobster indices of density and biomass within the MR continued to increase after 25Â years of protection, a period close to the species' lifespan. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) in weight more than doubled from years 21st to 25th without fishing in the reserve while the increase of CPUE in numbers was only 20{\%}. This faster increase in biomass reflected individual growth and spillover of predominantly smaller lobsters to adjacent grounds. A highly depleted status of exploited populations was inferred from the demographic structure and CPUEs, with fishery:MR ratios and reproductive potential indices below 0.05. In the MR the size-class of maximum egg production increased over time, in contrast to stable sizes classes in fished areas. The contribution of small lobster ({\textless}Â 90Â mm CL) to overall egg production was only 1.5{\%} in the MR and 30{\%} in the fished areas. Mortality estimated from recent size compositions was three to four times higher in fished areas than inside the MR, resulting in a reduction in predicted spawning potential per recruit close to 20{\%} of the unfished level. This experiment emphasizes the value of long-term no-take areas as reference laboratories for investigating fishing effects.},

abstract = {Species delimitation is problematic in many taxa due to the difficulty of evaluating predictions from species delimitation hypotheses, which chiefly relay on subjective interpretations of morphological observations and/or DNA sequence data. This problem is exacerbated in recalcitrant taxa for which genetic resources are scarce and inadequate to resolve questions regarding evolutionary relationships and uniqueness. In this case study we demonstrate the empirical utility of restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) by unambiguously resolving phylogenetic relationships among recalcitrant octocoral taxa with divergences greater than 80 million years. We objectively infer robust species boundaries in the genus Paragorgia , which contains some of the most important ecosystem engineers in the deep-sea, by testing alternative taxonomy-guided or unguided species delimitation hypotheses using the Bayes factors delimitation method (BFD*) with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data. We present conclusive evidence rejecting the current morphological species delimitation model for the genus Paragorgia and indicating the presence of cryptic species boundaries associated with environmental variables. We argue that the suitability limits of RAD-seq for phylogenetic inferences in divergent taxa cannot be assessed in terms of absolute time, but depend on taxon-specific factors such as mutation rate, generation time and effective population size. We show that classic morphological taxonomy can greatly benefit from integrative approaches that provide objective tests to species delimitation hypothesis. Our results pave the way for addressing further questions in biogeography, species ranges, community ecology, population dynamics, conservation, and evolution in octocorals and other marine taxa.},

@article{Puillandre2012,
abstract = {Within uncharacterized groups, DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences that are present in a wide range of species, can be used to assign organisms into species. We propose an automatic procedure that sorts the sequences into hypothetical species based on the barcode gap, which can be observed whenever the divergence among organisms belonging to the same species is smaller than divergence among organisms from different species. We use a range of prior intraspecific divergence to infer from the data a model-based one-sided confidence limit for intraspecific divergence. The method, called Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), then detects the barcode gap as the first significant gap beyond this limit and uses it to partition the data. Inference of the limit and gap detection are then recursively applied to previously obtained groups to get finer partitions until there is no further partitioning. Using six published data sets of metazoans, we show that ABGD is computationally efficient and performs well for standard prior maximum intraspecific divergences (a few per cent of divergence for the five data sets), except for one data set where less than three sequences per species were sampled. We further explore the theoretical limitations of ABGD through simulation of explicit speciation and population genetics scenarios. Our results emphasize in particular the sensitivity of the method to the presence of recent speciation events, via (unrealistically) high rates of speciation or large numbers of species. In conclusion, ABGD is fast, simple method to split a sequence alignment data set into candidate species that should be complemented with other evidence in an integrative taxonomic approach.},

The role of DNA barcoding in generating hypotheses of new taxa in need of formal taxonomic treatment is discussed, and it is emphasized that the recursive process of character evaluation is both necessary and best served by understanding the empirical mechanics of the discovery process. These undertakings carry enormous ramifications not only for the translation of DNA sequence data into taxonomic information but also for our comprehension of the magnitude of species diversity and its disappearance. This paper examines the potential strengths and pitfalls of integrating DNA sequence data, specifically in the form of DNA barcodes as they are currently generated and analyzed, with taxonomic practice.},

abstract = {Long-term research in the western English Channel, undertaken by the marine laboratories in Plymouth, is described and details of survey methods, sites, and time series given in this chapter. Major findings are summarized and their limitations outlined. Current research, with recent reestablishment and expansion of many sampling programmes, is presented, and possible future approaches are indicated. These unique long-term data sets provide an environmental baseline for predicting complex ecological responses to local, regional, and global environmental change. Between 1888 and the present, investigations have been carried out into the physical, chemical, and biological components (ranging from plankton and fish to benthic and intertidal assemblages) of the western English Channel ecosystem. The Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom has performed the main body of these observations. More recent contributions come from the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey, now the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, dating from 1957; the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, from 1974 to 1987; and the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which was formed by amalgamation of the Institute for Marine Environmental Research and part of the Marine Biological Association, from 1988. Together, these contributions constitute a unique data series - one of the longest and most comprehensive samplings of environmental and marine biological variables in the world. Since the termination of many of these time series in 1987-1988 during a reorganisation of UK marine research, there has been a resurgence of interest in long-term environmental change. Many programmes have been restarted and expanded with support from several agencies. The observations span significant periods of warming (1921-1961; 1985-present) and cooling (1962-1980). During these periods of change, the abundance of key species underwent dramatic shifts. The first period of warming saw changes in zooplankton, pelagic fish, and larval fish, including the collapse of an important herring fishery. During later periods of change, shifts in species abundances have been reflected in other assemblages, such as the intertidal zone and the benthic fauna. Many of these changes appear to be related to climate, manifested as temperature changes, acting directly or indirectly. The hypothesis that climate is a forcing factor is widely supported today and has been reinforced by recent studies that show responses of marine organisms to climatic attributes such as the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The long-term data also yield important insights into the effects of anthropogenic disturbances such as fisheries exploitation and pollution. Comparison of demersal fish hauls over time highlights fisheries effects not only on commercially important species but also on the entire demersal community. The effects of acute ("Torrey Canyon" oil spill) and chronic (tributyltin [TBT] antifoulants) pollution are clearly seen in the intertidal records. Significant advances in diverse scientific disciplines have been generated from research undertaken alongside the long-term data series. Many concepts in marine biological textbooks have originated in part from this work (e.g. the seasonal cycle of plankton, the cycling of nutrients, the pelagic food web trophic interactions, and the influence of hydrography on pelagic communities). Associated projects currently range from studies of marine viruses and bacterial ecology to zooplankton feeding dynamics and validation of ocean colour satellite sensors. Recent advances in technology mean these long-term programmes are more valuable than ever before. New technology collects data on finer temporal and spatial scales and can be used to capture processes that operate on multiple scales and help determine their influence in the marine environment. The MBA has been in the forefront of environmental modelling of shelf seas since the early 1970s. Future directions being pursued include the continued development of coupled physical-ecosystem models using western English Channel time-series data. These models will include both the recent high-resolution data and the long-term time-series information to predict effects of future climate change scenarios. It would be beneficial to provide more spatial and high-resolution temporal context to these data, which are fundamental for capturing processes that operate at multiple scales and understanding how they operate within the marine environment. This is being achieved through employment of technologies such as satellite-derived information and advanced telemetry instruments that provide real-time in situ profile data from the water column.},

All loci were polymorphic in the Scilly population, with 3â27 alleles per locus and expected heterozygosities of 0.07â0.96. Two loci deviated from HardyâWeinberg equi- librium possibly due to the presence of null alleles. No loci showed significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium fol- lowing correction for multiple tests. Cross-amplification was assessed in Alcyonium coralloides, Alcyonium acaule and Alcyonium palmatum collected from the French Mediterra- nean; six loci amplified successfully in at least one other species.

abstract = {While estimates of connectivity are important for effective management, few such estimates are available for reef invertebrates other than for corals. Barrel sponges are one of the largest and most conspicuous members of the coral reef fauna across the Indo-Pacific and given their large size, longevity and ability to process large volumes of water, they have a major role in reef functioning. Here we used a panel of microsatellite markers to characterise the genetic structure of two barrel sponge species, Xestospongia testudinaria and a currently undescribed Xestospongia species. We sampled across seven populations in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, SE Sulawesi (Indonesia) spanning a spatial scale of approximately 2 to 70 km, and present the first estimates of demographic connectivity for coral reef sponges. Genetic analyses showed high levels of genetic differentiation between all populations for both species, but contrasting patterns of genetic structuring for the two species. Autocorrelation analyses showed the likely dispersal distances of both species to be in the order of 60 and 140 m for Xestopongia sp. and Xestospongia testudinaria, respectively, which was supported by assignment tests that showed high levels of self-recruitment ({\textgreater}80{\%}). We also found consistently high inbreeding coefficients across all populations for both species. Our study highlights the potential susceptibility of barrel sponges to environmental perturbations because they are generally long-lived, slow growing, have small population sizes and are likely to be reliant on self-recruitment. Surprisingly, despite these features we actually found the highest abundance of both barrel sponge species (although they were generally smaller) at a site that has been severely impacted by humans over the last fifty years. This suggests that barrel sponges exhibit environmental adaptation to declining environmental quality and has important implications for the management and conservation of these important reef species.},

@article{Hewitt2004,
abstract = {An appreciation of the scale and frequency of climatic oscillations in the past few million years is modifying our views on how evolution proceeds. Such major events caused extinction and repeated changes in the ranges of those taxa that survived. Their spatial effects depend on latitude and topography, with extensive extinction and recolonization in higher latitudes and altitudinal shifts and complex refugia nearer the tropics. The associated population dynamics varied with life history and geography, and the present genetic constitution of the populations and species carry attenuated signals of these past dynamics. Phylogeographic studies with DNA have burgeoned recently and studies are reviewed from the arctic, temperate and tropical regions, seeking commonalities of cause in the resulting genetic patterns. Arctic species show distinct shallow genetic clades with common geographical boundaries. Thus Beringia is distinct phylogeographically, but its role as a refugial source is complex. Arctic taxa do not show the common genetic pattern of southern richness and northern purity in north-temperate species. Temperate refugial regions in Europe and North America show relatively deep DNA divergence for many taxa, indicating their presence over several Ice Ages, and suggesting a mode of speciation by repeated allopatry. DNA evidence indicates temperate species in Europe had different patterns of postglacial colonization across the same area and different ones in previous oscillations, whereas the northwest region of North America was colonized from the north, east and south. Tropical montane regions contain deeply diverged lineages, often in a relatively small geographical area, suggesting their survival there from the Pliocene. Our poor understanding of refugial biodiversity would benefit from further combined fossil and genetic studies.},

In this study, we used simulated and empirical data for a better understanding of the genetic structure in this species. We tested the impact of IBD between demes, sampling scheme and of clustering methods (BAPS, STRUCTURE or DAPC) on the inferred structure. By matching simulated scenarios to the empirical data, we first confirm that the genetic structure of the red coral is characterized by a combination between IBD and weak genetic breaks. Then, we demonstrate how the sampling scheme influences the results of the clustering methods. We also reveal the contrasted efficiencies of these methods to recover real demes or groups of demes in a context of IBD. Overall, our study underline the interest of comparing the results of different clustering methods and of using simulated data for interpreting empirical genetical data.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding-type studies assemble single-locus data from large samples of individuals and species, and have provided new kinds of data for evolutionary surveys of diversity. An important goal of many such studies is to delimit evolutionarily significant species units, especially in biodiversity surveys from environmental DNA samples. The Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) method is a likelihood method for delimiting species by fitting within- and between-species branching models to reconstructed gene trees. Although the method has been widely used, it has not previously been described in detail or evaluated fully against simulations of alternative scenarios of true patterns of population variation and divergence between species. Here, we present important reformulations to the GMYC method as originally specified, and demonstrate its robustness to a range of departures from its simplifying assumptions. The main factor affecting the accuracy of delimitation is the mean population size of species relative to divergence times between them. Other departures from the model assumptions, such as varying population sizes among species, alternative scenarios for speciation and extinction, and population growth or subdivision within species, have relatively smaller effects. Our simulations demonstrate that support measures derived from the likelihood function provide a robust indication of when the model performs well and when it leads to inaccurate delimitations. Finally, the so-called single-threshold version of the method outperforms the multiple-threshold version of the method on simulated data: we argue that this might represent a fundamental limit due to the nature of evidence used to delimit species in this approach. Together with other studies comparing its performance relative to other methods, our findings support the robustness of GMYC as a tool for delimiting species when only single-locus information is available.},

abstract = {In line with global targets agreed under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) is increasing rapidly, yet socio-economic benefits generated by MPAs remain difficult to predict and under debate. MPAs often fail to reach their full potential as a consequence of factors such as illegal harvesting, regulations that legally allow detrimental harvesting, or emigration of animals outside boundaries because of continuous habitat or inadequate size of reserve. Here we show that the conservation benefits of 87 MPAs investigated worldwide increase exponentially with the accumulation of five key features: no take, well enforced, old ({\textgreater}10 years), large ({\textgreater}100âkm(2)), and isolated by deep water or sand. Using effective MPAs with four or five key features as an unfished standard, comparisons of underwater survey data from effective MPAs with predictions based on survey data from fished coasts indicate that total fish biomass has declined about two-thirds from historical baselines as a result of fishing. Effective MPAs also had twice as many large ({\textgreater}250âmm total length) fish species per transect, five times more large fish biomass, and fourteen times more shark biomass than fished areas. Most (59{\%}) of the MPAs studied had only one or two key features and were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites. Our results show that global conservation targets based on area alone will not optimize protection of marine biodiversity. More emphasis is needed on better MPA design, durable management and compliance to ensure that MPAs achieve their desired conservation value.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circum-Antarctic waters harbour a rare example of a marine species flock - the Notothenioid fish, most species of which are restricted to the continental shelf. It remains an open question as to how they survived Pleistocene climatic fluctuations characterised by repeated advances of continental glaciers as far as the shelf break that probably resulted in a loss of habitat for benthic organisms. Pelagic ecosystems, on the other hand, might have flourished during glacial maxima due to the northward expansion of Antarctic polar waters. In order to better understand the role of ecological traits in Quaternary climatic fluctuations, we performed demographic analyses of populations of four fish species from the tribe Trematominae, including both fully benthic and pelagic species using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and an intron from the nuclear S7 gene.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nuclear and cytoplasmic markers showed differences in the rate and time of population expansions as well as the likely population structure. Neutrality tests suggest that such discordance comes from different coalescence dynamics of each marker, rather than from selective pressure. Demographic analyses based on intraspecific DNA diversity suggest a recent population expansion in both benthic species, dated by the cyt b locus to the last glacial cycle, whereas the population structure of pelagic feeders either did not deviate from a constant-size model or indicated that the onset of the major population expansion of these species by far predated those of the benthic species. Similar patterns were apparent even when comparing previously published data on other Southern Ocean organisms, but we observed considerable heterogeneity within both groups with regard to the onset of major demographic events and rates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our data suggest benthic and pelagic species reacted differently to the Pleistocene ice-sheet expansions that probably significantly reduced the suitable habitat for benthic species. However, the asynchronous timing of major demographic events observed in different species within both "ecological guilds", imply that the species examined here may have different population and evolutionary histories, and that more species should be analysed in order to more precisely assess the role of life history in the response of organisms to climatic changes.},

The aggregate of populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in drainages of Bristol Bay, Alaska, is the most abundant in the world and supports the largest high-value salmon fishery in North America. We applied molecular tools (genetic data from 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms, assayed in 96 populations) to detect migratory trends in stock composition of sockeye salmon returning to Bristol Bay and to inform fisheries management in real time. We reliably and repeatedly detected abundances that were unanticipated based upon preseason forecasts, fishing effort was shifted accordingly, and the fleet and local economies benefited while the risk of overharvesting weaker stocks was minimized. This approach is being developed for other species and fisheries and provides a useful model for conservation wherever migrating species are intensely managed.},

abstract = {Many molecular ecology analyses assume the genotyped individuals are sampled at random from a population and thus are representative of the population. Realistically, however, a sample may contain excessive close relatives (ECR) because, for example, localized juveniles are drawn from fecund species. Our knowledge is limited about how ECR affect the routinely conducted elementary genetics analyses, and how ECR are best dealt with to yield unbiased and accurate parameter estimates. This study quantifies the effects of ECR on some popular population genetics analyses of marker data, including the estimation of allele frequencies, F- statistics, expected heterozygosity (He), effective and observed numbers of alleles, and the tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage equilibrium (LE). It also investigates several strategies for handling ECR to mitigate their impact and to yield accurate parameter estimates. My analytical work, assisted by simulations, shows that ECR have large and global effects on all of the above marker analyses. The na{\"{i}}ve approach of simply ignoring ECR could yield low-precision and often biased parameter estimates, and could cause too many false rejections of HWE and LE. The bold approach, which simply identifies and removes ECR, and the cautious approach, which estimates target parameters (e.g. He) by accounting for ECR and using na{\"{i}}ve allele frequency estimates, eliminate the bias and the false HWE and LE rejections, but could reduce estimation precision substantially. The likelihood approach, which accounts for ECR in estimating allele frequencies and thus target parameters relying on allele frequencies, usually yields unbiased and the most accurate parameter estimates. Which of the four approaches is the most effective and efficient may depend on the particular marker analysis to be conducted. The results are discussed in the context of using marker data for understanding population properties and marker properties.},

abstract = {Microsatellite markers are widely used for estimating genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations. However, it has rarely been tested whether such estimates are useful proxies for genome-wide patterns of variation and differentiation. Here, we compared microsatellite variation with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess and quantify potential marker-specific biases and derive recommendations for future studies. Overall, we genotyped 180 Arabidopsis halleri individuals from nine populations using 20 microsatellite markers. Twelve of these markers were originally developed for Arabidopsis thaliana (cross-species markers) and eight for A. halleri (species-specific markers). We further characterized 2 million SNPs across the genome with a pooled whole-genome re-sequencing approach (Pool-Seq). Our analyses revealed that estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation derived from cross-species and species-specific microsatellites differed substantially and that expected microsatellite heterozygosity (SSR-H
                           e) was not significantly correlated with genome-wide SNP diversity estimates (SNP-H

                           r) was a better proxy for genome-wide SNP diversity. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations (F
                           ST) based on both marker types were correlated, but microsatellite-based estimates were significantly larger than those from SNPs. Possible causes include the limited number of microsatellite markers used, marker ascertainment bias, as well as the high variance in microsatellite-derived estimates. In contrast, genome-wide SNP data provided unbiased estimates of genetic diversity independent of whether genome- or only exome-wide SNPs were used. Further, we inferred that a few thousand random SNPs are sufficient to reliably estimate genome-wide diversity and to distinguish among populations differing in genetic variation. We recommend that future analyses of genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations use randomly selected high-throughput sequencing-based SNP data to draw conclusions on genome-wide diversity patterns. In species comparable to A. halleri, a few thousand SNPs are sufficient to achieve this goal.},

abstract = {Inferring phylogenetic relationships between closely related taxa can be hindered by three factors: (1) the lack of informative molecular variation at short evolu- tionary timescale; (2) the lack of established markers in poorly studied taxa; and (3) the potential phylogenetic conflicts among different genomic regions due to incomplete lineage sorting or introgression. In this context, Restriction site Asso- ciated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) seems promising as this technique can gener- ate sequence data from numerous DNA fragments scattered throughout the genome, from a large number of samples, and without preliminary knowledge on the taxa under study. However, divergence beyond the within-species level will necessarily reduce the number of conserved and non-duplicated restriction sites, and therefore the number of loci usable for phylogenetic inference. Here, we assess the suitability of RAD-seq for phylogeny using a simulated experiment on the 12 Drosophila genomes, with divergence times ranging from 5 to 63 million years. These simulations show that RAD-seq allows the recovery of the known Drosophila phylogeny with strong statistical support, even for relatively ancient nodes. Notably, this conclusion is robust to the potentially confounding effects of sequencing errors, heterozygosity, and low coverage. We further show that clus- tering RAD-seq data using the BLASTN and SiLiX programs significantly improves the recovery of orthologous RAD loci compared with previously pro- posed approaches, especially for distantly related species. This study therefore val- idates the view that RAD sequencing is a powerful tool for phylogenetic inference.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature Understanding the patterns of connectivity is required by the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011â2020 and will be used to guide the extension of marine protection measures. Despite the increasing accuracy of ocean circulation modelling, the capacity to model the population connectivity of sessile benthic species with dispersal larval stages can be limited due to the potential effect of filters acting before or after dispersal, which modulates offspring release or settlement, respectively. We applied an interdisciplinary approach that combined demographic surveys, genetic methods (assignment tests and coalescent-based analyses) and larval transport simulations to test the relative importance of demographics and ocean currents in shaping the recent patterns of gene flow among populations of a Mediterranean gorgonian (Eunicella singularis) in a fragmented rocky habitat (Gulf of Lion, NW Mediterranean Sea). We show that larval transport is a dominant driver of recent gene flow among the populations, and significant correlations were found between recent gene flow and larval transport during an average single dispersal event when the pelagic larval durations (PLDs) ranged from 7 to 14 d. Our results suggest that PLDs that efficiently connect populations distributed over a fragmented habitat are filtered by the habitat layout within the species competency period. Moreover, a PLD ranging from 7 to 14 d is sufficient to connect the fragmented rocky substrate of the Gulf of Lion. The rocky areas located in the centre of the Gulf of Lion, which are currently not protected, were identified as essential hubs for the distribution of migrants in the region. We encourage the use of a range of PLDs instead of a single value when estimating larval transport with biophysical models to identify potential connectivity patterns among a network of Marine Protected Areas or even solely a seascape.},

abstract = {Numerous deep-sea species have apparent widespread and discontinuous distributions. Many of these are important foundation species, structuring hard-bottom benthic ecosystems. Theoretically, differences in the genetic composition of their populations vary geographically and with depth. Previous studies have examined the genetic diversity of some of these taxa in a regional context, suggesting that genetic differentiation does not occur at scales of discrete features such as seamounts or canyons, but at larger scales (e.g. ocean basins). However, to date, few studies have evaluated such diversity throughout the known distribution of a putative deep-sea species. We utilized sequences from seven mitochondrial gene regions and nuclear genetic variants of the deep-sea coral Paragorgia arborea in a phylogeographic context to examine the global patterns of genetic variation and their possible correlation with the spatial variables of geographic position and depth. We also examined the compatibility of this morphospecies with the genealogical-phylospecies concept by examining specimens collected worldwide. We show that the morphospecies P.Â arborea can be defined as a genealogical-phylospecies, in contrast to the hypothesis that P.Â arborea represents a cryptic species complex. Genetic variation is correlated with geographic location at the basin-scale level, but not with depth. Additionally, we present a phylogeographic hypothesis in which P.Â arborea originates from the North Pacific, followed by colonization of the Southern Hemisphere prior to migration to the North Atlantic. This hypothesis is consistent with the latest ocean circulation model for the Miocene.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have suggested that hybridization may play a previously unrecognized and important role in the evolution of corals. Our observations of polymorphic and recombinant sequences in the multicopy ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region suggested the possible hybrid origin of two European soft coral species, Alcyonium hibernicum and Bellonella bocagei. To examine this possibility further we cloned and sequenced ITS-1 from multiple individuals and populations of these two species as well as two sympatric congeners, A. coralloides and A. sp. M2. Phylogenetic analyses separated the observed sequence variants into two distinct clades. All A. coralloides sequences belonged to clade A, while A. sp. M2 had only clade B sequences. A majority of A. hibernicum individuals, however, contained both clade A and B sequences that were identical to the predominant sequence variants found in A. coralloides and A. sp. M2, respectively. This pattern of additivity suggests that A. hibernicum originated from a hybrid cross between A. coralloides and A. sp. M2, a hypothesis that is supported by its unusual mode of reproduction (meiotic parthenogenesis). The predominant sequence variant found in B. bocagei was a unique, derived clade B sequence; in addition, however, most individuals of this species also had copies of a sequence identified as a recombinant between clade A and clade B sequence types. The presence of this recombinant sequence in the B. bocagei genome suggests that this species may also be the product of past hybridization events within the clade. Reticulate evolution may explain the failure of several previous studies to resolve the phylogeny of these four species.},

abstract = {Microsatellite genotyping is a common DNA characterization technique in population, ecological and evolutionary genetics research. Since different alleles are sized relative to internal size-standards, different laboratories must calibrate and standardize allelic designations when exchanging data. This interchange of microsatellite data can often prove problematic. Here, 16 microsatellite loci were calibrated and standardized for the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, across 12 laboratories. Although inconsistencies were observed, particularly due to differences between migration of DNA fragments and actual allelic size ('size shifts'), inter-laboratory calibration was successful. Standardization also allowed an assessment of the degree and partitioning of genotyping error. Notably, the global allelic error rate was reduced from 0.05 Â± 0.01 prior to calibration to 0.01 Â± 0.002 post-calibration. Most errors were found to occur during analysis (i.e. when size-calling alleles; the mean proportion of all errors that were analytical errors across loci was 0.58 after calibration). No evidence was found of an association between the degree of error and allelic size range of a locus, number of alleles, nor repeat type, nor was there evidence that genotyping errors were more prevalent when a laboratory analyzed samples outside of the usual geographic area they encounter. The microsatellite calibration between laboratories presented here will be especially important for genetic assignment of marine-caught Atlantic salmon, enabling analysis of marine mortality, a major factor in the observed declines of this highly valued species.},

The ever-expanding size of genetic data sets poses computational challenges for this analysis. Although at least one tool currently implements parallel computing to reduce computational overload of this analysis, it does not fully automate the use of replicate STRUCTURE analysis runs required for downstream inference of optimal K. There is pressing need for a tool that can deploy population structure analysis on high performance computing clusters. Results: We present an updated version of the popular Python program StrAuto, to streamline population structure analysis using parallel computing. StrAuto implements a pipeline that combines STRUCTURE analysis with the Evanno analysis and visualization of results using STRUCTURE HARVESTER. Using benchmarking tests, we demonstrate that StrAuto significantly reduces the computational time needed to perform iterative STRUCTURE analysis by distributing runs over two or more processors. Conclusion: StrAuto is the first tool to integrate STRUCTURE analysis with post-processing using a pipeline approach in addition to implementing parallel computation â a set up ideal for deployment on computing clusters.

abstract = {* The Mantel test is widely used in biology, including landscape ecology and genetics, to detect spatial structures in data or control for spatial correlation in the relationship between two data sets, for example community composition and environment. The study demonstrates that this is an incorrect use of that test. * The null hypothesis of the Mantel test differs from that of correlation analysis; the statistics computed in the two types of analyses differ. We examined the basic assumptions of the Mantel test in spatial analysis and showed that they are not verified in most studies. We showed the consequences, in terms of power, of the mismatch between these assumptions and the Mantel testing procedure. * The Mantel test H0 is the absence of relationship between values in two dissimilarity matrices, not the independence between two random variables or data tables. The Mantel R2 differs from the R2 of correlation, regression and canonical analysis; these two statistics cannot be reduced to one another. Using simulated data, we show that in spatial analysis, the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity of the Mantel test (H1: small values of D1 correspond to small values of D2 and large values of D1 to large values of D2) do not hold in most cases, except when spatial correlation extends over the whole study area. Using extensive simulations of spatially correlated data involving different representations of geographic relationships, we show that the power of the Mantel test is always lower than that of distance-based Moran's eigenvector map (dbMEM) analysis and that the Mantel R2 is always smaller than in dbMEM analysis, and uninterpretable. These simulation results are novel contributions to the Mantel debate. We also show that regression on a geographic distance matrix does not remove the spatial structure from response data and does not produce spatially uncorrelated residuals. * Our main conclusion is that Mantel tests should be restricted to questions that, in the domain of application, only concern dissimilarity matrices, and are not derived from questions that can be formulated as the analysis of the vectors and matrices from which one can compute dissimilarity matrices.},

abstract = {The comparison of genetic divergence or genetic distances, estimated by pairwise FST and related statistics, with geographical distances by Mantel test is one of the most popular approaches to evaluate spatial processes driving population structure. There have been, however, recent criticisms and discussions on the statistical performance of the Mantel test. Simultaneously, alternative frameworks for data analyses are being proposed. Here, we review the Mantel test and its variations, including Mantel correlograms and partial correlations and regressions. For illustrative purposes, we studied spatial genetic divergence among 25 populations of Dipteryx alata ("Baru"), a tree species endemic to the Cerrado, the Brazilian savannas, based on 8 microsatellite loci. We also applied alternative methods to analyze spatial patterns in this dataset, especially a multivariate generalization of Spatial Eigenfunction Analysis based on redundancy analysis. The different approaches resulted in similar estimates of the magnitude of spatial structure in the genetic data. Furthermore, the results were expected based on previous knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying genetic variation in this species. Our review shows that a careful application and interpretation of Mantel tests, especially Mantel correlograms, can overcome some potential statistical problems and provide a simple and useful tool for multivariate analysis of spatial patterns of genetic divergence.},

abstract = {The distribution and demographic patterns of marine organisms in the north Atlantic were largely shaped by climatic changes during the Pleistocene, when recurrent glacial maxima forced them to move south or to survive in northern peri-glacial refugia. These patterns were also influenced by biological and ecological factors intrinsic to each species, namely their dispersion ability. The ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta), the largest labrid fish along Europe's continental margins, is a target for fisheries and aquaculture industry. The phylogeographic pattern, population structure, potential glacial refugia and recolonization routes for this species were assessed across its full distribution range, using mitochondrial and nuclear markers. The existence of a marked population structure can reflect both recolonization from three distinct glacial refugia and current and past oceanographic circulation patterns. Although isolated in present times, shared haplotypes between continental and Azores populations and historical exchange of migrants in both directions point to a common origin of L. bergylta. This situation is likely to be maintained and/or accentuated by current circulation patterns in the north Atlantic, and may lead to incipient speciation in the already distinct Azorean population. Future monitoring of this species is crucial to evaluate how this species is coping with current environmental changes.},

The rapid development of genomic methods has posed an important question, namely where do genetics and genomics sit in relation to their application in the conservation of species? Although genetics can answer a number of relevant questions related to conservation, the argument for the application of genomics is not yet fully exploited. Here, we explore the transition and rationale for the move from genetic to genomic research in conservation biology and the utility of such research. We explore the idea of a 'conservation prior' and how this can be determined by genomic data and used in the management of populations. We depict three different conservation scenarios and describe how genomic data can drive management action in each situation. We conclude that the most effective applications of genomics will be to inform stakeholders with the aim of avoiding 'emergency room conservation'.},

Bridging this gap requires a clear understanding of the barriers to use of genetics by conservation practitioners, but few (if any) papers on this topic involve direct consultation with practitioners themselves. We surveyed 148 conservation practitioners in New Zealand's Department of Conservation regarding their attitude to, knowledge of, and experiences with genetics for conservation. Although practitioners were largely receptive to using genetics for conservation management, access to expertise and funding remains a barrier to use. Practitioners would like to collaborate with geneticists at universities or other institutes, but do not necessarily know who to talk to or fully understand how genetics might benefit them. We contend these barriers or similar likely exist at an international level, suggest ways they might be overcome, and emphasise the need for clearer communication between geneticists and practitioners.},

abstract = {DNA sequence data from genetic (traditional) and genomic (high-throughput) instruments have been highlighted as important information for biodiversity conservation. Despite a high number of publications, a gap has emerged between fundamental research and real-world application, meaning genetic studies often do not have a substantive link to policy or conservation science. We conducted a meta-analysis on conservation studies using genetic and genomic datasets and found the majority of publications were on species that were data deficient or of low conservation priority (66{\%}); only 38{\%} of studies specifically identified how the data could inform conservation or management through clearly stated recommendations for action or policy. Importantly, our mixed-model found a 2.5-fold increase in the odds of a publication making a specific recommendation when non-academic affiliated authors were included. This suggests the conservation genetics gap has arisen, in part, by academic authors failing to make explicit links to policy and conservation outcomes. Conservation geneticists should refrain from hyperbole and collaborate with agency and non-government scientists to accelerate development and implementation, and ultmately help bridge the conservation genetics gap.},

The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged â¥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

@article{Foster2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Foster et al.Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a management tool used to respond to human-derived threats in marine ecosystems. Historically, MPAs have been established on an individual ad hoc basis, rather than through a systematic, planned process. However, high levels of functional and spatial connectivity within marine ecosystems have led to the suggestion that networks of MPAs provide greater ecological benefits than individual MPAs. Consequently, international policy has developed to consider broader spatial requirements for marine conservation, resulting in a number of international and regional agreements that require the establishment of ecologically coherent MPA networks. Existing MPAs are now being considered, retrospectively, alongside new designations, as networks of MPAs across regions, both nationally and internationally. Under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), France, the Republic of Ireland, and the UK (including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man) are required to work together to ensure coordinated development of marine strategies for the Celtic Seas subregion. Accordingly, MPAs have been identified as crucial components of the programme of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) under the MSFD. Here, we provide the first ecological coherence assessment of an MPA network spanning an MSFD subregion. A network of 533 MPAs, or parts thereof, across the Celtic Seas subregion was assessed using five criteria and two methodologies, with a focus on broadscale habitats. While the Celtic Seas MPA network as a whole is not ecologically coherent (according to accepted thresholds), progress toward a number of global targets has been achieved, for example, protection of 10{\%} of marine and coastal areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Further, all MSFD predominant habitat types assessed are adequately represented and replicated within the network. However, a number of gaps were identified, including a lack of MPAs in offshore and deeper areas, and inadequate proportions of predominant habitat types within MPAs. Addressing these gaps to enable the MPA network to fulfill its critical role in the delivery of GES under the MSFD will require both national progress toward designation of adequate and viable MPAs and transboundary agreements and coordination of MPA designation processes at the European level.},

Here we compared assignment tests and parentage analysis for examining larval retention and connectivity under two different gene flow scenarios using panda clownfish (Amphiprion polymnus) in Papua New Guinea. A metapopulation of panda clownfish in Bootless Bay with little or no genetic differentiation among five spatially discrete locations separated by 2-6 km provided the high gene flow scenario. The low gene flow scenario compared the Bootless Bay metapopulation with a genetically distinct population (F(ST )= 0.1) located at Schumann Island, New Britain, 1500 km to the northeast. We used assignment tests and parentage analysis based on microsatellite DNA data to identify natal origins of 177 juveniles in Bootless Bay and 73 juveniles at Schumann Island. At low rates of gene flow, assignment tests correctly classified juveniles to their source population. On the other hand, parentage analysis led to an overestimate of self-recruitment within the two populations due to the significant deviation from panmixia when both populations were pooled. At high gene flow (within Bootless Bay), assignment tests underestimated self-recruitment and connectivity among subpopulations, and grossly overestimated self-recruitment within the overall metapopulation. However, the assignment tests did identify immigrants from distant (genetically distinct) populations. Parentage analysis clearly provided the most accurate estimates of connectivity in situations of high gene flow.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is being lost at an ever increasing rate (Butchart et al., 2010), leading to the degradation of ecosystems ser-vices to levels that threaten human well-being. There are significant global efforts to address this situation: spending on conservation in 2006 by major international organiza-tions and non-governmental organizations was, for example, estimated to reach {\$}2 billion per annum (Halpern et al., 2006), a level that has likely to have increased since that study was published. Yet, this is a drop in the ocean as compared to the requirement of over {\$}76 billion per annum to protect threaten species and the sites they occupy (McCarthy et al., 2012). Given that we cannot continue to unsustainably use natural resources as we have in the past (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2003), better ways of protecting bio-diversity have to be found, and quickly. In particular, there is clear consensus that better informed decisions are urgently needed about what needs to be conserved; where, how and why. The answer to all of these questions requires evidence; science is the source of much of that evidence. Global policy makers understand that science is required to support management and policy decisions; to quote from the main page of the Intergovernmental Platform for Bio-diversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) â 'To achieve this [the adoption and implementation of adequate policies to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services], decision makers need scientifically credible and independent information that takes into account the complex relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem services, and people. They also need effective methods to interpret this scientific information in order to make informed decisions' (http://www.ipbes.net/ about-ipbes.html). The type of research relevant to conser-vation that is published in scientific journals such as Animal Conservation should, therefore, be fundamental to inform-ing the decisions that are made about how biodiversity is protected and how conservation funding is allocated. Conservation science addresses the biology of popula-tions, species, communities and ecosystems that are per-turbed, either directly or indirectly, by human activities or other agents (Soul{\'{e}}, 1985) and provides understanding and advice about how these can be managed. It is at its founda-tion, an applied science, seeking to provide information that makes a difference to the planet's biodiversity (Meine, Soul{\'{e}} {\&} Noss, 2006). Conservation scientists want to have their research put into practice through, for example, changes in management or policy that support or legislate for changes in behaviours, investment or practices. Their research should, therefore, align with the needs of those who use the information, knowledge and innovation that derive from the endeavours of conservation scientists. The track record is not great, however (Whitten, Holmes {\&} MacKinnon, 2001; Arlettaz et al., 2010). Several authors have suggested that the continued loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services exposes an implementation gap between the theory and practice of conservation science (e.g. Knight et al., 2008). In many cases, scientists do not engage in plan-ning for the implementation or dissemination of their research and even those that do plan often have little impact upon practice. The first step on the journey to improve the impact of their science is for conservation scientists to more precisely},

Augmentation can be demographically and economically beneficial but can also cause four types of adverse genetic change to wild populations: (1) loss of genetic variation, (2) loss of adaptations, (3) change of population composition, and (4) change of population structure. While adverse genetic impacts are recognized and documented in fisheries, little effort is devoted to actually monitoring them. In forestry and wildlife management, genetic risks associated with releases are largely neglected. We outline key features of programs to effectively monitor consequences of such releases on natural populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of molecular techniques for parentage analysis has been a booming science for over a decade. The most important technological breakthrough was the introduction of microsatellite markers to molecular ecology, an advance that was accompanied by a proliferation and refinement of statistical techniques for the analysis of parentage data. Over the last several years, we have seen steady progress in a number of areas related to parentage analysis, and the prospects for successful studies continue to improve. Here, we provide an updated guide for scientists interested in embarking on parentage analysis in natural or artificial populations of organisms, with a particular focus on computer software packages that implement various methods of analysis. Our survey of the literature shows that there are a few established methods that perform extremely well in the analysis of most types of parentage studies. However, particular experimental designs or study systems can benefit from some of the less well-known computer packages available. Overall, we find that parentage analysis is feasible and satisfying in most systems, and we try to provide a simple roadmap to help other scientists navigate the confusing topography of statistical techniques.},

abstract = {Since the middle of the 1990s, parentage assignment using microsatellite markers has been introduced as a tool in aquaculture breeding. It now allows close to 100{\%} assignment success, and offered new ways to develop aquaculture breeding using mixed family designs in commercial conditions. Its main achievements are the knowledge and control of family representation and inbreeding, especially in mass spawning species, above all the capacity to estimate reliable genetic parameters in any species and rearing system with no prior investment in structures, and the development of new breeding programs in many species. Parentage assignment should not be seen as a way to replace physical tagging, but as a new way to conceive breeding programs, which have to be optimized with its specific constraints, one of the most important being to well define the number of individuals to genotype to limit costs, maximize genetic gain while minimizing inbreeding. The recent possible shift to (for the moment) more costly single nucleotide polymorphism markers should benefit from future developments in genomics and marker-assisted selection to combine parentage assignment and indirect prediction of breeding values.},

abstract = {Interest has surged recently in removing siblings from population genetic datasets before conducting downstream analyses. However, even if the pedigree is inferred correctly, this has the potential to do more harm than good. We used computer simulations and empirical samples of coho salmon to evaluate strategies for adjusting samples to account for family structure. We compared performance in full samples and sibling-reduced samples of estimators of allele frequency (P), population differentiation (FST), and effective population size (Ne). Results: 1) Unless simulated samples included large family groups together with a component of unrelated individuals, removing siblings generally reduced precision of Pand FST; 2) Nebased on the linkage-disequilibrium method was largely unbiased using full random samples but became increasingly upwardly biased under aggressive purging of siblings. Under non-random sampling (some families over-represented), Neusing full samples was downwardly biased; removing just the right âGoldilocksâ fraction of siblings could produce an unbiased estimate, but this sweet spot varied widely among scenarios; 3) Weighting individuals based on the inferred pedigree (to produce a best-linear-unbiased-estimator, BLUE) maximized precision of P when the inferred pedigree was correct but performed poorly when the pedigree was wrong; 4) A variant of sibling removal that leaves intact small sibling groups appears to be more robust to errors in inferences about family structure. Our results illustrate the complex challenges posed by presence of family structure, suggest that no single optimal solution exists, and argue for caution in adjusting population-genetic datasets for the presence of putative siblings without fully understanding the consequences.

Astacidea show unexpectedly diverse genomic organizations. Ten different gene arrangements have been observed in the 28 investigated species. Compared with the decapod ground pattern, a huge inversion, involving more than half of the mitogenome, has been found in four freshwater crayfish species of Astacoidea and convergently in one lobster species. Surprisingly, this inversion can also be observed in the distantly related Priapulida. This multiple convergent evolution suggests a relative ease in the evolution of great similarities in mito- chondrial gene order. In addition, a partial or complete loss of the protein-coding gene nad2 has been found in E. occidentalis and H. gammarus but not in Nephrops norvegicus, Homarus americanus and Enoplometopus debelius. A reversal of the strand asymmetry has been found in five astacideans which is supposed to be caused by the inversion of a replication origin in the control region.},

abstract = {Abstract: Effective population size (Ne) determines the strength of genetic drift in a population and has long been recognized as an important parameter for evaluating conservation status and threats to genetic health of populations. Specifically, an estimate of Ne is crucial to management because it integrates genetic effects with the life history of the species, allowing for predictions of a population's current and future viability. Nevertheless, compared with ecological and demographic parameters, Ne has had limited influence on species management, beyond its application in very small populations. Recent developments have substantially improved Ne estimation; however, some obstacles remain for the practical application of Ne estimates. For example, the need to define the spatial and temporal scale of measurement makes the concept complex and sometimes difficult to interpret. We reviewed approaches to estimation of Ne over both long-term and contemporary time frames, clarifying their interpretations with respect to local populations and the global metapopulation. We describe multiple experimental factors affecting robustness of contemporary Ne estimates and suggest that different sampling designs can be combined to compare largely independent measures of Ne for improved confidence in the result. Large populations with moderate gene flow pose the greatest challenges to robust estimation of contemporary Ne and require careful consideration of sampling and analysis to minimize estimator bias. We emphasize the practical utility of estimating Ne by highlighting its relevance to the adaptive potential of a population and describing applications in management of marine populations, where the focus is not always on critically endangered populations. Two cases discussed include the mechanisms generating Ne estimates many orders of magnitude lower than census N in harvested marine fishes and the predicted reduction in Ne from hatchery-based population supplementation.

Espec{\'{i}}ficamente, una estimaci{\'{o}}n de Ne es crucial para el manejo porque integra los efectos gen{\'{e}}ticos con la historia de vida de la especie, lo que permite predicciones de la viabilidad actual y futura de una poblaci{\'{o}}n. Sin embargo, comparado con par{\'{a}}metros ecol{\'{o}}gicos y demogr{\'{a}}ficos, Ne ha tenido una influencia limitada sobre el manejo de especies, m{\'{a}}s all{\'{a}} de su aplicaci{\'{o}}n en poblaciones muy peque{\~{n}}as. Desarrollos recientes han mejorado sustancialmente la estimaci{\'{o}}n de Ne; sin embargo, persisten algunos obst{\'{a}}culos para la aplicaci{\'{o}}n pr{\'{a}}ctica de las estimaciones de Ne, Por ejemplo, la necesidad de definir la escala espacial y temporal de la medida hace que el concepto sea complejo y dif{\'{i}}cil de interpretar en algunas ocasiones.

The number of samples available and targeted number of RADseq loci are important criteria when choosing between these methods. Neither method suffered any apparent bias due to the effects of allele dropout typical of RAD data. With an understanding of the limitations and biases of these approaches, researchers can make more informed decisions when designing their sampling and analyses. Overall, our results reveal that demographic inference using RADseq data can be successfully applied to infer recent population size change and may be an important tool for population monitoring and conservation biology.},

Furthermore, few tools exist that are specifically designed for analyzing data from clonal populations, making analysis difficult and haphazard. We developed the R package poppr providing unique tools for analysis of data from admixed, clonal, mixed, and/or sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used for dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text files and can be analyzed on a user-defined hierarchy that includes unlimited levels of subpopulation structure and clone censoring. New functions include calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellites, batch-analysis of the index of association with several indices of genotypic diversity, and graphing including dendrograms with bootstrap support and minimum spanning networks. While functions for genotypic diversity and clone censoring are specific for clonal populations, several functions found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any populations. A manual with documentation and examples is provided. Poppr is open source and major releases are available on CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr.

@article{Waples2006,
abstract = {We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered 'populations'. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high ( approximately 100{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H(0): Nm {\textless} X) can also be high, provided that true Nm {\textless} or = 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm {\textless} or = 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future.},

A successful example is reconstruction of the genetic history of African Americans who are a product of recent admixture between highly differentiated populations. Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups which do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach (available at www.paintmychromsomes.com) to assessing the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry 'palettes' estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated and real examples. Combining these complementary analyses with additional methods that are designed to test specific hypothesis allows a richer and more robust analysis of recent demographic history based on genetic data.},

abstract = {One of the primary goals of population genetics is to succinctly describe genetic relationships among populations, and the computer program STRUCTURE is one of the most frequently used tools for doing so. The mathematical model used by STRUCTURE was designed to sort individuals into Hardy-Weinberg populations, but the program is also frequently used to group individuals from a large number of populations into a small number of clusters that are supposed to represent the main genetic divisions within species. In this study, I used computer simulations to examine how well STRUCTURE accomplishes this latter task. Simulations of populations that had a simple hierarchical history of fragmentation showed that when there were relatively long divergence times within evolutionary lineages, the clusters created by STRUCTURE were frequently not consistent with the evolutionary history of the populations. These difficulties can be attributed to forcing STRUCTURE to place individuals into too few clusters. Simulations also showed that the clusters produced by STRUCTURE can be strongly influenced by variation in sample size. In some circumstances, STRUCTURE simply put all of the individuals from the largest sample in the same cluster. A reanalysis of human population structure suggests that the problems I identified with STRUCTURE in simulations may have obscured relationships among human populations-particularly genetic similarity between Europeans and some African populations.},

abstract = {Loci responsible for local adaptation are likely to have more genetic differentiation among populations than neutral loci. However, neutral loci can vary widely in their amount of genetic dif- ferentiation, even over the same geographic range. Unfortunately, the distribution of differentiationâas measured by an index such as FST âdepends on the details of the demographic history of the pop- ulations in question, even without spatially heterogeneous selection. Many methods designed to detect FST outliers assume a specific model of demographic history, which can result in extremely high false pos- itive rates for detecting loci under selection. We develop a new method that infers the distribution of FST for loci unlikely to be strongly af- fected by spatially diversifying selection, using data on a large set of loci with unknown selective properties. Compared to previous meth- ods, this approach, called OutFLANK, has much lower false positive rates and comparable power, as shown by simulation. Keywords:},

In this study we empirically confirmed that fewer than 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were needed to accurately conduct PBT, we demonstrated that our selected panel of SNPs was comparable in accuracy to a panel of microsatellites, and we verified that stock assignments made with this panel matched those made using CWTs. We also demonstrated that when sampling of spawners was incomplete, an estimated PBT rate for the offspring could also be predicted with fewer than 100 SNPs.

abstract = {Sequencing large number of individuals, which is often needed for population genetics studies, is still economically challenging despite falling costs of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Pool-seq is an alternative cost- and time-effective option in which DNA from several individuals is pooled for sequencing. However, pooling of DNA creates new problems and challenges for accurate variant call and allele frequency (AF) estimation. In particular, sequencing errors confound with the alleles present at low frequency in the pools possibly giving rise to false positive variants. We sequenced 996 individuals in 83 pools (12 individuals/pool) in a targeted re-sequencing experiment. We show that Pool-seq AFs are robust and reliable by comparing them with public variant databases and in-house SNP-genotyping data of individual subjects of pools. Furthermore, we propose a simple filtering guideline for the removal of spurious variants based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test. We experimentally validated our filters by comparing Pool-seq to individual sequencing data showing that the filters remove most of the false variants while retaining majority of true variants. The proposed guideline is fairly generic in nature and could be easily applied in other Pool-seq experiments.},

Officially reported landings, however, may be underestimates of total catch in many fisheries. We investigated the fishery for the nationally red-listed European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) in south-eastern Norway. Probability-based strip transect surveys were used to count buoys in the study area in combination with catch per unit effort data obtained independently from volunteer catch diaries, phone interviews, and questionnaires. We estimate that recreational catch accounts for 65{\%} of total catch in the study area. Moreover, our results indicate that only a small proportion (24{\%}) of lobsters landed commercially were sold through the legal market and documented. Total estimated lobster catch was nearly 14 times higher than reported officially. Our study highlights the need for adequate catch monitoring and data collection efforts in coastal areas, presents a clear warning to resource managers that illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fisheries in coastal areas should not be ignored, and shows the potential impact of recreational fisheries.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd. The Baltic Sea has a rare type of brackish water environment which harbours unique genetic lineages of many species. The area is highly influenced by anthropogenic activities and is affected by eutrophication, climate change, habitat modifications, fishing and stocking. Effective genetic management of species in the Baltic Sea is highly warranted in order to maximize their potential for survival, but shortcomings in this respect have been documented. Lack of knowledge is one reason managers give for why they do not regard genetic diversity in management. Here, the current knowledge of population genetic patterns of species in the Baltic Sea is reviewed and summarized with special focus on how the information can be used in management. The extent to which marine protected areas (MPAs) protect genetic diversity is also investigated in a case study of four key species. Sixty-one species have been studied genetically in the Baltic Sea, but comprehensive genetic information exists for only seven of them. Genetic monitoring shows genetic stability in some species but fluctuations and genetic changes in others. About half of the scientific studies published during the last 6 years provide conservation advice, indicating a high interest in the scientific community for relating results to practical management. Populations in MPAs do not differ genetically from populations outside MPAs, indicating that MPAs in the Baltic Sea do not protect genetic diversity specifically, but that populations in MPAs are a representative subset of populations in the Baltic Sea. Recommendations are provided for cases where genetic information is available but not used in management, particularly for non-commercial species with important ecosystem function. Improved channels for effective communication between academia and practical management on Baltic Sea genetic biodiversity are needed. A web page that can be used for knowledge transfer is highlighted here.},

A total of 86,468 SNPs were identified from Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) libraries, and reduced to 1517 following the application of quality control filters and stringent selection criteria. A subsample of SNPs were chosen for the design of high-throughput SNP assays and a training set of known parents and offspring was then used to achieve further filtering. A panel comprising 94 SNPs balanced across the salmon genome were identified, providing 100{\%} assignment accuracy in known pedigrees. Additionally, the panel was able to assign individuals to one of three farmed salmon populations used in this study with 100{\%} accuracy. We conclude that the workflow described is suitable for the design of cost effective parentage assignment and traceability tools for aquaculture species.},

Rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing technology and the simultaneous development of bioinformatic tools have democratized the field. It is now within reach for individual research groups in the eco-evolutionary and conservation community to generate de novo draft genome sequences for any organism of choice. Because of the cost and considerable effort involved in such an endeavour, the important first step is to thoroughly consider whether a genome sequence is necessary for addressing the biological question at hand. Once this decision is taken, a genome project requires careful planning with respect to the organism involved and the intended quality of the genome draft. Here, we briefly review the state of the art within this field and provide a step-by-step introduction to the workflow involved in genome sequencing, assembly and annotation with particular reference to large and complex genomes.

abstract = {Advancing technologies have facilitated the ever-widening application of genetic markers such as microsatellites into new systems and research questions in biol-ogy. In light of the data and experience accumulated from several years of using microsatellites, we present here a literature review that synthesizes the limita-tions of microsatellites in population genetic studies. With a focus on popula-tion structure, we review the widely used fixation (F ST) statistics and Bayesian clustering algorithms and find that the former can be confusing and problem-atic for microsatellites and that the latter may be confounded by complex pop-ulation models and lack power in certain cases. Clustering, multivariate analyses, and diversity-based statistics are increasingly being applied to infer population structure, but in some instances these methods lack formalization with microsatellites. Migration-specific methods perform well only under nar-row constraints. We also examine the use of microsatellites for inferring effec-tive population size, changes in population size, and deeper demographic history, and find that these methods are untested and/or highly context-depen-dent. Overall, each method possesses important weaknesses for use with micro-satellites, and there are significant constraints on inferences commonly made using microsatellite markers in the areas of population structure, admixture, and effective population size. To ameliorate and better understand these con-straints, researchers are encouraged to analyze simulated datasets both prior to and following data collection and analysis, the latter of which is formalized within the approximate Bayesian computation framework. We also examine trends in the literature and show that microsatellites continue to be widely used, especially in non-human subject areas. This review assists with study design and molecular marker selection, facilitates sound interpretation of microsatellite data while fostering respect for their practical limitations, and identifies lessons that could be applied toward emerging markers and high-throughput technologies in population genetics.},

abstract = {Extreme and remote environments provide useful settings to test ideas about the ecological and evolutionary drivers of biological diversity. In the sub-Antarctic, isolation by geographic, geological and glaciological processes has long been thought to underpin patterns in the region's terrestrial and marine diversity. Molecular studies using increasingly high-resolution data are, however, challenging this perspective, demonstrating that many taxa disperse among distant sub-Antarctic landmasses. Here, we reconsider connectivity in the sub-Antarctic region, identifying which taxa are relatively isolated, which are well connected, and the scales across which this connectivity occurs in both terrestrial and marine systems. Although many organisms show evidence of occasional long-distance, trans-oceanic dispersal, these events are often insufficient to maintain gene flow across the region. Species that do show evidence of connectivity across large distances include both active dispersers and more sedentary species. Overall, connectivity patterns in the sub-Antarctic at intra- and inter-island scales are highly complex, influenced by life-history traits and local dynamics such as relative dispersal capacity and propagule pressure, natal philopatry, feeding associations, the extent of human exploitation, past climate cycles, contemporary climate, and physical barriers to movement. An increasing use of molecular dataÂ âÂ particularly genomic data sets that can reveal fine-scale patternsÂ âÂ and more effective international collaboration and communication that facilitates integration of data from across the sub-Antarctic, are providing fresh insights into the processes driving patterns of diversity in the region. These insights offer a platform for assessing the ways in which changing dispersal mechanisms, such as through increasing human activity and changes to wind and ocean circulation, may alter sub-Antarctic biodiversity patterns in the future.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged â¥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {On Thursday 23rd June 2016, the British people voted in a referen- dum on the following question: âShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?' Of the 33,551,983who voted, 51.9{\%} (17,410,742) voted to leave (48.1{\%} voted to remain). Although there is an agreed basic framework, as there is no precedent for a country leaving the European Union (EU), there is a lack of clarity surrounding the process and timetable for Brexit.1 The UK has to reformulate its relationship with the rest of the EU during a 2-year period triggered by the request to leave under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (effective 2009). The start of that âdivorce settlement' is triggered by the Member State (the UK) and as yet (July 2016) the UK Government position is not to trigger Article 50 until their negotiating position has been defined internally. The 2-year period is separate to the âframework agreement' with the rest of Europe which will take an undefined time to negotiate. The latterwill be a reversal of the lengthy process of joining the EU to ensure alignment of theMember State laws with EU law, and could possibly take between 10 and 20 years.},

Here we show that only 5.7{\%} of scleractinian coral species and 21.7{\%} of labrid fish species reach the minimum protection target of 10{\%} of their geographic ranges within MPAs. We also estimate that the current global MPA system secures only 1.7{\%} of the Tree of Life for corals, and 17.6{\%} for fishes. Regionally, the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific show the greatest deficit of protection for corals while for fishes this deficit is located primarily in the Western Indian Ocean and in the Central Pacific.

abstract = {1. Ecological and evolutionary research increasingly uses quantitative synthesis of primary research studies (meta-analysis) for answering fundamental questions, informing environmental policy and summarizing results for decision makers. 2. Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as substantial contri-butions to a larger picture. 3. To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research studies must be found and basic informa-tion about the methods and results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While many pub-lished papers provide this information, it is common for essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from meta-analyses. 4. We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from primary studies in ecology and evolu-tionary biology so that they can be included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes, and how data should be made accessible. 5. These guidelines are important for reporting research results in general, whether or not results are included in subsequent meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by funders, will foster higher quality and more inclusive syntheses, further the goals of transparency and reproducibility in science, and improve the quality and value of primary research studies.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing approaches Abstract Whole-genome resequencing (WGR) is a powerful method for addressing fundamental evolutionary biology questions that have not been fully resolved using traditional methods. WGR includes four approaches: the sequencing of individuals to a high depth of coverage with either unresolved (huWGR) or resolved haplotypes (hrWGR), the sequencing of population genomes to a high depth by mixing equimolar amounts of unlabelled-individual DNA (Pool-seq), and the sequencing of multiple individuals from a population to a low depth (lcWGR). These techniques require the availability of a reference genome. This, along with the still high cost of shotgun sequencing and the large demand for computing resources and storage, has limited their implementation in non-model species with scarce genomic resources and in fields such as conservation biology. Our goal here is to describe the various WGR methods, their pros and cons, and potential applications in conservation biology. WGR offers an unprecedented marker density and surveys a wide diversity of genetic variations not limited to single nucleotide polymorphisms (e.g. structural variants and mutations in regulatory elements), increasing their power for the detection of signatures of selection and local adaptation as well as for the identification of the genetic basis of phenotypic traits and diseases. Currently though, no single WGR approach fulfills all requirements of conservation genetics, and each method has its own limitations and sources of potential bias. We discuss proposed ways to minimize such biases. We envision a not distant future where the analysis of whole genomes becomes a routine task in many non-model species and fields including conservation biology},

In the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), the existence of several populations has been proposed but a global view is missing. Using a multidisciplinary approach, here we assessed the divergence among different ecotypes and its possible causes. SNPs have revealed two functionally distinct ecotypes overlapping in the Central Mediterranean, with one ecotype confined near the river estuaries. The same SNPs outliers also segregated two distinct populations in the near Atlantic, despite their large spatial distance. In addition, while most studies suggested that adaptation to low salinity is key to divergence, here we show that the offshore ecotype has higher environmental tolerance and an opportunistic feeding behaviour, as assessed by the study of environmental conditions, anchovy diet and trophic levels, and passive egg dispersal. These results provide insights into the anchovy evolutionary history, stressing the importance of behaviour in shaping ecotypes.},

However, such changes are difficult to quantify because information on present species distribution and the genetic variation within species is lacking or poorly examined.

To improve knowledge of distribution and genetic structure of the Mytilus edulis complex in the Arctic, we analyzed 81 SNPs in 534 Mytilus spp. individuals sampled at 13 sites to provide baseline data for distribution and genetic variation of Mytilus mussels in the European Arctic. Mytilus edulis was the most abundant species found with a clear genetic split between populations in Greenland and the Eastern Atlantic. Surprisingly, analyses revealed the presence of Mytilus trossulus in high Arctic NW Greenland (77 degrees N) and Mytilus galloprovincialis or their hybrids in SW Greenland, Svalbard, and the Pechora Sea. Furthermore, a high degree of hybridization and introgression between species was observed. Our study highlights the importance of distinguishing between congener species, which can display local adaptation and suggests that information on dispersal routes and barriers is essential for accurate predictions of regional susceptibility to range expansions or invasions of boreal species in the Arctic.},

abstract = {Conservation and management of exploited species depends on accurate knowledge of how genetic variation is partitioned across a fishery, especially as it relates to recruitment. Using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, we surveyed variation in 7,382 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) young-of-the-year (YOY) sampled at six localities and in adults sampled at two localities in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Significant genetic heterogeneity was detected between the two adult samples, separated by {\~{}}600âkm, and at spatial scales less than five kilometers among samples of âYOY. Genetic differences between YOY samples and between YOY samples and adult samples were not associated with geographic distance, and a genome scan revealed no evidence of loci under selection. Estimates of the effective number of breeders, allelic richness, and relatedness within YOY samples were not consistent with sweepstakes recruitment. Instead, the data demonstrate, at least within one recruitment season, that multiple pulses of recruits originate from distinct groups of spawning adults, even at small spatial scales. For exploited species with this type of recruitment pattern, protection of spawning adults over wide geographic areas may be critical for ensuring productivity and stability of the fishery by maintaining larval supply and connectivity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Genetic markers are widely used to understand the biology and population dynamics of disease vectors, but often markers are limited in the resolution they provide. In particular, the delineation of population structure, fine scale movement and patterns of relatedness are often obscured unless numerous markers are available. To address this issue in the major arbovirus vector, the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti), we used double digest Restriction-site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing for the discovery of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We aimed to characterize the new SNP set and to test the resolution against previously described microsatellite markers in detecting broad and fine-scale genetic patterns in Ae. aegypti. RESULTS We developed bioinformatics tools that support the customization of restriction enzyme-based protocols for SNP discovery. We showed that our approach for RAD library construction achieves unbiased genome representation that reflects true evolutionary processes. In Ae. aegypti samples from three continents we identified more than 18,000 putative SNPs. They were widely distributed across the three Ae. aegypti chromosomes, with 47.9{\%} found in intergenic regions and 17.8{\%} in exons of over 2,300 genes. Pattern of their imputed effects in ORFs and UTRs were consistent with those found in a recent transcriptome study. We demonstrated that individual mosquitoes from Indonesia, Australia, Vietnam and Brazil can be assigned with a very high degree of confidence to their region of origin using a large SNP panel. We also showed that familial relatedness of samples from a 0.4 km2 area could be confidently established with a subset of SNPs. CONCLUSIONS Using a cost-effective customized RAD sequencing approach supported by our bioinformatics tools, we characterized over 18,000 SNPs in field samples of the dengue fever mosquito Ae. aegypti. The variants were annotated and positioned onto the three Ae. aegypti chromosomes. The new SNP set provided much greater resolution in detecting population structure and estimating fine-scale relatedness than a set of polymorphic microsatellites. RAD-based markers demonstrate great potential to advance our understanding of mosquito population processes, critical for implementing new control measures against this major disease vector.},

We expected Nassau grouper to exhibit genetic differentiation among its subpopulations due to its reproductive behavior and retentive oceanographic conditions experienced across the Caribbean basin. All samples were genotyped for two mitochondrial markers and 9 microsatellite loci, and a subset of samples were genotyped for 4,234 SNPs. We found evidence of genetic differentiation in a Caribbean-wide study of this mass-aggregating marine fish using mtDNA (FSTâ=â0.206, p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.001), microsatellites (FSTâ=â0.002, pâ=â0.004) and SNPs (FSTâ=â0.002, pâ=â0.014), and identified three potential barriers to larval dispersal. Genetically isolated regions identified in our work mirror those seen for other invertebrate and fish species in the Caribbean basin. Oceanographic regimes in the Caribbean may largely explain patterns of genetic differentiation among Nassau grouper subpopulations.

An efficient SNP identification system requires a marker set with enough power to identify individuals and their parents. Genetic diagnostics generally include the analysis of related animals. In this work, the degree of information provided by SNPs for a consanguineous herd of cattle was compared with that provided by STRs. Thirty-six closely related Angus cattle were genotyped for 18 STRs and 116 SNPs. Cumulative SNPs exclusion power values (Q) for paternity and sample matching probability (MP) yielded values greater than 0.9998 and 4.32E(-42), respectively. Generally 2-3 SNPs per STR were needed to obtain an equivalent Q value. The MP showed that 24 SNPs were equivalent to the ISAG (International Society for Animal Genetics) minimal recommended set of 12 STRs (MP â¼ 10(-11)). These results provide valuable genetic data that support the consensus SNP panel for bovine genetic identification developed by the Parentage Recording Working Group of ICAR (International Committee for Animal Recording).},

abstract = {Current ABSTRACT Identifying and monitoring locally adaptive genetic variation can have direct utility for conserving species at risk, especially when management may include actions such as translocations for restoration, genetic rescue, or assisted gene flow. However, genomic studies of local adaptation require careful planning to be successful, and in some cases may not be a worthwhile use of resources. Here, we offer an adaptive management framework to help conservation biologists and managers decide when genomics is likely to be effective in detecting local adaptation, and how to plan assessment and monitoring of adaptive variation to address conservation objectives. Studies of adaptive variation using genomic tools will inform conservation actions in many cases, including applications such as assisted gene flow and identifying conservation units. In others, assessing genetic diversity, inbreeding, and demographics using selectively neutral genetic markers may be most useful. And in some cases, local adaptation may be assessed more efficiently using alternative approaches such as common garden experiments. Here we identify key considerations of genomics studies of locally adaptive variation, provide a roadmap for successful collaborations with genomics experts including key issues for study design and data analysis, and offer guidelines for interpreting and using results from genomic assessments to inform monitoring programs and conservation actions.},

abstract = {Deep coral reefs (that is, mesophotic coral ecosystems) can act as refuges against major disturbances affecting shallow reefs. It has been proposed that, through the provision of coral propagules, such deep refuges may aid in shallow reef recovery; however, this âreseedingâ hypothesis remains largely untested. We conducted a genome-wide assessment of two scleractinian coral species with contrasting reproductive modes, to assess the potential for connectivity between mesophotic (40 m) and shallow (12 m) depths on an isolated reef system in the Western Atlantic (Bermuda). To overcome the pervasive issue of endosymbiont contamination associated with de novo sequencing of corals, we used a novel subtraction reference approach. We have demonstrated that strong depth-associated selection has led to genome-wide divergence in the brooding species Agaricia fragilis (with divergence by depth exceeding divergence by location). Despite introgression from shallow into deep populations, a lack of first-generation migrants indicates that effective connectivity over ecological time scales is extremely limited for this species and thus precludes reseeding of shallow reefs from deep refuges. In contrast, no genetic structuring between depths (or locations) was observed for the broadcasting species Stephanocoenia intersepta , indicating substantial potential for vertical connectivity. Our findings demonstrate that vertical connectivity within the same reef system can differ greatly between species and that the reseeding potential of deep reefs in Bermuda may apply to only a small number of scleractinian species. Overall, we argue that the âdeep reef refuge hypothesisâ holds for individual coral species during episodic disturbances but should not be assumed as a broader ecosystem-wide phenomenon.},

The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genome-scale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outlier methods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scan methods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species' demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation. With attention to their current limitations, genome scan methods can be an important tool in finding the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change.},

Here, we evaluated the feasibility of using genotyping-by-sequencing of non-invasively collected hair samples to simultaneously identify and genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a climate-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We identified and genotyped 3,803 high-confidence SNPs across eight sites distributed along two elevational transects using starting DNA amounts as low as 1 ng. Fifty-five outlier loci were detected as candidate gene regions under divergent selection, constituting potential targets for future validation. Genome-wide estimates of gene diversity significantly and positively correlated with elevation across both transects, with all low elevation sites exhibiting significant heterozygote deficit likely due to inbreeding. More broadly, our results highlight a range of issues that must be considered when pairing genomic data collection with non-invasive sampling, particularly related to field sampling protocols for minimizing exogenous DNA, data collection strategies and quality control steps for enhancing target organism yield, and analytical approaches for maximizing cost-effectiveness and information content of recovered genomic data.},

abstract = {Genomic studies of invasive species can reveal both invasive pathways and functional dif- ferences underpinning patterns of colonization success. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) was initially introduced to eastern North America nearly 200 years ago where it expanded northwards to eastern Nova Scotia. A subsequent invasion to Nova Scotia from a northern European source allowed further range expansion, providing a unique opportunity to study the invasion genomics of a species with multiple invasions. Here, we use restriction- site- associated DNA sequencing- derived SNPs to explore fine- scale genomewide differen- tiation between these two invasions. We identified 9137 loci from green crab sampled from 11 locations along eastern North America and compared spatial variation to mitochondrial COI sequence variation used previously to characterize these invasions. Overall spatial di- vergence among invasions was high (pairwise FST {\~{}}0.001 to 0.15) and spread across many loci, with a mean FST {\~{}}0.052 and 52{\%} of loci examined characterized by FST values {\textgreater}0.05. The majority of the most divergent loci (i.e., outliers, {\~{}}1.2{\%}) displayed latitudinal clines in allele frequency highlighting extensive genomic divergence among the invasions. Discriminant analysis of principal components (both neutral and outlier loci) clearly resolved the two invasions spatially and was highly correlated with mitochondrial divergence. Our results reveal extensive cryptic intraspecific genomic diversity associated with differing patterns of colonization success and demonstrates clear utility for genomic approaches to delineating the distribution and colonization success of aquatic invasive species.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the molecular signatures of selection in species lacking an available closely related reference genome remains challenging, yet it may provide valuable fundamental insights into the capacity of populations to respond to environmental cues. We screened 25 native populations of the tree species Frangula alnus subsp. alnus (Rhamnaceae), covering three different geographical scales, for 183 annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Standard population genomic outlier screens were combined with individual-based and multivariate landscape genomic approaches to examine the strength of selection relative to neutral processes in shaping genomic variation, and to identify the main environmental agents driving selection. Our results demonstrate a more distinct signature of selection with increasing geographical distance, as indicated by the proportion of SNPs (i) showing exceptional patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation (outliers) and (ii) associated with climate. Both temperature and precipitation have an important role as selective agents in shaping adaptive genomic differentiation in F. alnus subsp. alnus, although their relative importance differed among spatial scales. At the 'intermediate' and 'regional' scales, where limited genetic clustering and high population diversity were observed, some indications of natural selection may suggest a major role for gene flow in safeguarding adaptability. High genetic diversity at loci under selection in particular, indicated considerable adaptive potential, which may nevertheless be compromised by the combined effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation.Heredity advance online publication, 6 May 2015; doi:10.1038/hdy.2015.41.},

A total of 6,647 SNPs were assigned to 22 linkage groups, which is equal to the number of chromosome pairs in turbot. For the first time, the average marker interval reached 0.3958 cM, which is equal to approximately 0.1203 Mb of the turbot genome. The observed 99.34{\%} genome coverage indicates that the linkage map was genome-wide. A total of 220 Quantitative Traits Locus (QTLs) associated with two body length traits, two body weight traits in different growth periods and sex determination were detected with an LOD {\textgreater} 5.0 in 12 linkage groups (LGs), which explained the corresponding phenotypic variance (R-2), ranging from 14.4-100{\%}. Among them, 175 overlapped with linked SNPs, and the remaining 45 were located in regions between contiguous SNPs. According to the QTLs related to growth trait distribution and the changing of LGs during different growth periods, the growth traits are likely controlled by multi-SNPs distributed on several LGs; the effect of these SNPs changed during different growth periods. Most sex-related QTLs were detected at LG 21 with a linkage span of 70.882 cM. Additionally, a small number of QTLs with high feasibility and a narrow R-2 distribution were also observed on LG7 and LG14, suggesting that multi LGs or chromosomes might be involved in sex determination. High homology was recorded between LG21 in Cynoglossus semilaevis and turbot. This high-saturated turbot RAD-Seq linkage map is undoubtedly a promising platform for marker assisted selection (MAS) and flatfish genomics research.},

abstract = {Selective breeding is increasingly recognized as a key component of sustainable production of aquaculture species. The uptake of genomic technology in aquaculture breeding has traditionally lagged behind terrestrial farmed animals. However, the rapid development and application of sequencing technologies has allowed aquaculture to narrow the gap, leading to substantial genomic resources for all major aquaculture species. While high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays for some species have been developed recently, direct genotyping by sequencing (GBS) techniques have underpinned many of the advances in aquaculture genetics and breeding to date. In particular, restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and subsequent variations have been extensively applied to generate population-level SNP genotype data. These GBS techniques are not dependent on prior genomic information such as a reference genome assembly for the species of interest. As such, they have been widely utilized by researchers and companies focussing on nonmodel aquaculture species with relatively small research communities. Applications of RAD-Seq techniques have included generation of genetic linkage maps, performing genome-wide association studies, improvements of reference genome assemblies and, more recently, genomic selection for traits of interest to aquaculture like growth, sex determination or disease resistance. In this review, we briefly discuss the history of GBS, the nuances of the various GBS techniques, bioinformatics approaches and application of these techniques to various aquaculture species.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Investigating migratory connectivity between breeding and foraging areas is critical to effective management and conservation of highly mobile marine taxa, particularly threatened, endangered, or economically important species that cross through regional, national and international boundaries. The leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea, Vandelli 1761) is one such transboundary species that spends time at breeding areas at low latitudes in the northwest Atlantic during spring and summer. From there, they migrate widely throughout the North Atlantic, but many show fidelity to one region off eastern Canada, where critical foraging habitat has been proposed. Our goal was to identify nesting beach origins for turtles foraging here. Using genetics, we identified natal beaches for 288 turtles that were live-captured off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Turtles were sampled (skin or blood) and genotyped using 17 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Results from three assignment testing programs (ONCOR, GeneClass2 and Structure) were compared. Our nesting population reference data set included 1417 individuals from nine Atlantic nesting assemblages. A supplementary data set for 83 foraging turtles traced to nesting beaches using flipper tags and/or PIT tags (n = 72), or inferred from satellite telemetry (n = 11), enabled ground-truthing of the assignments. We first assigned turtles using only genetic information and then used the supplementary recapture information to verify assignments. ONCOR performed best, assigning 64 of the 83 recaptured turtles to natal beaches (77{\textperiodcentered}1{\%}). Turtles assigned to Trinidad (164), French Guiana (72), Costa Rica (44), St. Croix (7), and Florida (1) reflect the relative size of those nesting populations, although none of the turtles were assigned to four other potential source nesting assemblages. Our results demonstrate the utility of genetic approaches for determining source populations of foraging marine animals and include the first identification of natal rookeries of male leatherbacks, identified through satellite telemetry and verified with genetics. This work highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and tagging programmes in nesting and high-use foraging areas. Moreover, it provides a scientific basis for evaluating stock-specific effects of fisheries on migratory marine species, thus identifying where coordinated international recovery efforts may be most effective.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been proposed by some as the new frontier for population studies, and several papers have presented theoretical and empirical evidence reporting the advantages and limitations of SNPs. As a practical matter, however, it remains unclear how many SNP markers will be required or what the optimal characteristics of those markers should be in order to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect different levels of population differentiation. We use a hypothetical case to illustrate the process of designing a population genetics project, and present results from simulations that address several issues for maximizing statistical power to detect differentiation while minimizing the amount of effort in developing SNPs. Results indicate that (i) while {\~{}}30 SNPs should be sufficient to detect moderate (F(ST) = 0.01) levels of differentiation, studies aimed at detecting demographic independence (e.g. F(ST) {\textless} 0.005) may require 80 or more SNPs and large sample sizes; (ii) different SNP allele frequencies have little affect on power, and thus, selection of SNPs can be relatively unbiased; (iii) increasing the sample size has a strong effect on power, so that the number of loci can be minimized when sample number is known, and increasing sample size is almost always beneficial; and (iv) power is increased by including multiple SNPs within loci and inferring haplotypes, rather than trying to use only unlinked SNPs. This also has the practical benefit of reducing the SNP ascertainment effort, and may influence the decision of whether to seek SNPs in coding or noncoding regions.},

This principle is commonly overlooked when the classification procedure in question is population assignment using a set of genetic markers that were chosen specifically on the basis of their allele frequencies from amongst a larger number of candidate markers. This oversight leads to a systematic upward bias in the predicted accuracy of the chosen set of markers for population assignment. Three widely used software programs for selecting markers informative for population assignment suffer from this bias. The extent of this bias is documented through a small set of simulations. The relative effect of the bias is largest when screening many candidate loci from poorly differentiated populations. Simple unbiased methods are presented and their use encouraged.},

abstract = {A puzzling question in conservation biology is how to maintain overall fitness of individuals bred in captive environment upon release into the wild, especially for rehabilitating declining or threatened species. For salmonid species, a heritable change in fitness related traits and gene expression has been reported to occur in a single generation of captivity in hatchery environment. Such rapid changes are congruent with models of inadvertent domestication selection which may lead to maladaptation in the natural environment. Arguably, the underlying mechanism by which captivity may induce fitness difference between wild and captive congeners is still poorly understood. Short-term selection on complex phenotypic traits is expected to induce subtle changes in allele frequency over multiple loci. Yet, most studies investigating the molecular basis for rapid change in fitness related traits occurring in hatchery have concentrated their effort on finding evidence for selection at the genome level by identifying loci with large effect. Numerous wild stocks of Pacific anadromous salmon and trout (genus Oncorhynchus and Salmo) have experienced fluctuating abundance over the past century, with a series of sharp declines. With the objectives of preserving ecosystem integrity, enhancing declining populations and sustaining fisheries, conservation hatcheries have been flourishing. This is particularly true along the North American Pacific coast where billions of salmonids, all species included, are released each year. Despite substantial improvement of production management, the beneficial ecological role of hatcheries in enhancing and restoring wild stocks is still debated, mainly because of the reduced fitness and maladaptation of hatchery-fish when released in the wild. Although previous studies showed that domestication selection was involved in such fitness impairment, they also observed that different environmental conditions (e.g. reduced fish density) significantly modulated the physiological acclimation to hatchery environment. Environmental stimuli are especially relevant during early embryonic development, which also correspond to a sensitive methylation reprogramming window in vertebrates. It is therefore plausible that differences in rearing environment during early development may result in epigenetic modifications that could in turn impact on fitness. However, the only epigenetic study to date pertaining to captive rearing in salmonids and performed using methylation-sensitive amplified fragments (MSAP) failed to identify significant changes in methylation profile associated with hatchery rearing. Here, we used a higher resolution approach to compare the genome-wide pattern of methylation in hatchery-reared juvenile (smolt) Coho Salmon with that of their wild counterparts in two geographically distant rivers in British Columbia, Canada. Using a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) approach covering an average per individual of about 70 million cytosines in CpG context, we identified 100 methylated regions (DMRs) that differed in parallel between hatchery and natural origin salmon in both rivers. The total variance of epigenetic variation among individuals explained by river or origin and rearing environment in a RDA model was 16{\%} (adj.R2=0.16), and both variables equally explained about 8{\%} of the variance after controlling for each other. The gene ontology analysis revealed that regions with different methylation levels between hatchery and natural origin salmon showed enrichment for ion homeostasis, synaptic and neuromuscular regulation, immune and stress response, and control of locomotion functions. We further identified 15,044 SNPs that allowed detection of significant differences between either rivers or sexes. However, no effect of rearing environment was observed, confirming that hatchery and natural origin fish of a given river belong to the same panmictic population, as expected based on the hatchery programs applied in these rivers (see Supplementary experimental procedures). Moreover, neither a standard genome-scan approach nor a polygenic statistical framework allowed detection of selective effects within a single generation between hatchery and natural origin salmon. Therefore, this is the first study to demonstrate that parallel epigenetic modifications induced by hatchery rearing during early development may represent a potential explanatory mechanism for rapid change in fitness-related traits previously reported in salmonids.},

In this study, we implemented and validated a relatively low cost nanofluidic system for SNP-GT with and without Specific Target Amplification (STA). As proof of principle, we first validated the effect of input DNA copy number on genotype call rate using well characterised, digital PCR (dPCR) quantified human genomic DNA samples and then implemented the validated method to genotype 45 SNPs in the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, nuclear genome. When STA was not incorporated, for a homozygous human DNA sample, reaction chambers containing, on average 9 to 97 copies, showed 100{\%} call rate and accuracy. Below 9 copies, the call rate decreased, and at one copy it was 40{\%}. For a heterozygous human DNA sample, the call rate decreased from 100{\%} to 21{\%} when predicted copies per reaction chamber decreased from 38 copies to one copy. The tightness of genotype clusters on a scatter plot also decreased. In contrast, when the same samples were subjected to STA prior to genotyping a call rate and a call accuracy of 100{\%} were achieved. Our results demonstrate that low input DNA copy number affects the quality of data generated, in particular for a heterozygous sample. Similar to human genomic DNA, a call rate and a call accuracy of 100{\%} was achieved with whale genomic DNA samples following multiplex STA using either 15 or 45 SNP-GT assays. These calls were 100{\%} concordant with their true genotypes determined by an independent method, suggesting that the nanofluidic system is a reliable platform for executing call rates with high accuracy and concordance in genomic sequences derived from biological tissue.},

abstract = {Because of their high variability, microsatellites are still considered the marker of choice for studies on parentage and kinship in wild populations. Nevertheless, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are becoming increasing popular in many areas of molecular ecology, owing to their high-throughput, easy transferability between laboratories and low genotyping error. An ongoing discussion concerns the relative power of SNPs compared to microsatellites-that is, how many SNP loci are needed to replace a panel of microsatellites? Here, we evaluate the assignment power of 80 SNPs (H(E) = 0.30, 80 independent alleles) and 11 microsatellites (H(E) = 0.85, 192 independent alleles) in a wild population of about 400 sockeye salmon with two commonly used software packages (Cervus3, Colony2) and, for SNPs only, a newly developed software (SNPPIT). Assignment success was higher for SNPs than for microsatellites, especially for parent pairs, irrespective of the method used. Colony2 assigned a larger proportion of offspring to at least one parent than the other methods, although Cervus and SNPPIT detected more parent pairs. Identification of full-sib groups without parental information from relatedness measures was possible using both marker systems, although explicit reconstruction of such groups in Colony2 was impossible for SNPs because of computation time. Our results confirm the applicability of SNPs for parentage analyses and refute the predictability of assignment success from the number of independent alleles.},

abstract = {A detailed understanding of the genetic structure of populations and an accurate interpretation of processes driving contemporary patterns of gene flow are fundamental to successful spatial conservation management. The field of seascape genetics seeks to incorporate environmental variables and processes into analyses of population genetic data to improve our understanding of forces driving genetic divergence in the marine environment. Information about barriers to gene flow (such as ocean currents) is used to define a resistance surface to predict the spatial genetic structure of populations and explain deviations from the widely applied isolation-by-distance model. The majority of seascape approaches to date have been applied to linear coastal systems or at large spatial scales (more than 250 km), with very few applied to complex systems at regional spatial scales (less than 100 km). Here, we apply a seascape genetics approach to a peripheral population of the broadcast-spawning coral Acropora spicifera across the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, a high-latitude complex coral reef system off the central coast of Western Australia. We coupled population genetic data from a panel of microsatellite DNA markers with a biophysical dispersal model to test whether oceanographic processes could explain patterns of genetic divergence. We identified significant variation in allele frequencies over distances of less than 10 km, with significant differentiation occurring between adjacent sites but not between the most geographically distant ones. Recruitment probabilities between sites based on simulated larval dispersal were projected into a measure of resistance to connectivity that was significantly correlated with patterns of genetic divergence, demonstrating that patterns of spatial genetic structure are a function of restrictions to gene flow imposed by oceanographic currents. This study advances our understanding of the role of larval dispersal on the fine-scale genetic structure of coral populations across a complex island system and applies a methodological framework that can be tailored to suit a variety of marine organisms with a range of life-history characteristics.},

abstract = {The identification of thousands of variants across the genomes and their accurate genotyping are crucial for estimating the genetic parameters needed to address a host of molecular ecological and evolutionary questions. With rapid advances of massively parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies, several methods have recently been developed to access genome-wide data on population variation. One of the most successful and widely used techniques relies on the combination of restriction enzymes and sequencing-by-synthesis: Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq). We developed a new, more time- and cost-efficient double-digest RAD paired-end protocol (quaddRAD) that simplifies and speeds up the identification of PCR duplicates and permits large-scale multiplexing. Assessing its performances on a technical dataset, we also applied the quaddRAD method on population samples of a Neotropical cichlid fish lineage (Archocentrus centrarchus) to assess its genetic structure and demographic history. While we identified allopatric inter-lake genetic divergence, most likely driven by drift, no signature of sympatric divergence was detected. This differs from what has been observed in Midas cichlids (Amphilophus citrinellus spp.), another cichlid lineage that inhabits the same lakes and shares a similar demographic history, but have evolved into small-scale adaptive radiations via sympatric speciation. We demonstrate that quaddRAD is a robust and efficient method for genotyping a massive number and widely overlapping set of loci with high accuracy. Furthermore, the results on A. centrarchus open new research avenues providing an ideal system to investigate genome-level mechanisms that could alter the speciation potential of different but closely related cichlid lineages.},

abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via "SNP chip" microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the status of stock-enhancement studies on the clawed lobster, particularly recent experiments on \textit{Homarus gammarus} in European waters. Previous attempts from the 1850s onwards with both H. gammarus and H. americanus showed little success, but since 1980, lobsters reared in the hatchery to juvenile stage XII have been released in substantial numbers at a range of sites in the United Kingdom, France, Norway, and Ireland. Releases on the order of thousands have yielded recaptures on the order of hundreds. This new success arises because juveniles were microwire tagged, released directly by divers onto known lobster habitat, and subsequently recaptured by dedicated field sampling and monitoring of commercial lobster landings. Hatchery lobsters showed little dispersal, they required 4 to 5 yrs to reach legal size, and some ovigerous females were recaptured. Field sampling tentatively suggests survival to legal size as high as 50{\%}, but the overall recapture rate in the fishery was below 5{\%}. Recaptures seem marginally higher in areas of low lobster density, but the experiments were not designed to answer ecological questions, and they cannot be used, to make substantive predictions about how stocking density and the local abundance of natural stock will affect survival and recapture rate. Before the biological and economic benefits of enhancement programs can be assessed, experimental testing is needed of whether hatchery-reared juveniles supplement or replace naturally settled lobsters. At current levels of recruitment, enhancement programs seem unlikely to be worthwhile, particularly compared with the implementation of restrictive management measures, but enhancement programs can be justified where there is some clear evidence of recruitment failure, as in Norway. At present lobster prices, the current recapture rate is well below that required to cover the present cost of constructing and running a moderate-sized hatchery from scratch. This economic appraisal is discouraging from a "put-and-take" ranching perspective, but a program aimed at enhancing breeding stock and independently financed from associated tourism or sea-life-center activity is still potentially viable.},

abstract = {Time-scales estimated from sequence data play an important role in molecular ecology. They can be used to draw correlations between evolutionary and palaeoclimatic events, to measure the tempo of speciation, and to study the demographic history of an endangered species. In all of these studies, it is paramount to have accurate estimates of time-scales and substitution rates. Molecular ecological studies typically focus on intraspecific data that have evolved on genealogical scales, but often these studies inappropriately employ deep fossil calibrations or canonical substitution rates (e.g., 1{\%} per million years for birds and mammals) for calibrating estimates of divergence times. These approaches can yield misleading estimates of molecular time-scales, with significant impacts on subsequent evolutionary and ecological inferences. We illustrate this calibration problem using three case studies: avian speciation in the late Pleistocene, the demographic history of bowhead whales, and the Pleistocene biogeography of brown bears. For each data set, we compare the date estimates that are obtained using internal and external calibration points. In all three cases, the conclusions are significantly altered by the application of revised, internally-calibrated substitution rates. Collectively, the results emphasise the importance of judicious selection of calibrations for analyses of recent evolutionary events.},

A total of 11 and 21 individuals of T. albacares and S. brasiliensis, respectively, were used for SNP identification. DNA was individually digested with two restriction enzymes (SbfI and SphI) and fragments between 300 and 600. bp selected. Combinatorial barcoding was used to identify individuals by including short sequences (5-7. bp) in the adaptors of each restriction site (P1 and P2). After adaptor ligation, samples were pooled and size-selected, amplified by PCR, and sequenced on a 454 GS-Junior sequencer. A total of 180,779 reads were produced with an average length and coverage of 287. bp and 26x, respectively.

abstract = {Understanding connectivity of marine organisms is necessary for determining the appropriate scale of conservation and management strategies. For species that inhabit both the coastal ocean and partially enclosed water bodies (i.e., estuaries or fjords), this information is even more critical since estuaries and fjords are often characterized by hydrological complexities which can limit dispersal potential and promote population subdivision. In this study, genetic connectivity of Dungeness crab Cancer magister in Puget Sound and coastal Washington, USA, was examined to test the hypothesis of genetic structure in partially enclosed versus open environments. Dungeness crab that were sampled at five sites in Puget Sound in 2015 and three sites in coastal Washington in 2014 were genotyped at ten microsatellite loci. We observed similar levels of heterozygosity and allelic richness within Puget Sound and coastal Washington. Pairwise FST estimates indicated that Hood Canal was significantly differentiated from other Puget Sound sites, except Nisqually, suggesting larval retention within the Hood Canal basin. No evidence for significant genetic differentiation was found among the four remaining Puget Sound sites or among the three coastal sites. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that, in aggregate, Puget Sound sites significantly differed from coastal sites. On a site by site basis, we found evidence for significant differentiation between three sites in Puget Sound and coastal Washington. Based upon the observed patterns of genetic differentiation, our findings did not support our hypothesis of restricted genetic connectivity within Puget Sound, with the exception of Hood Canal. However, our results demonstrate that there is stronger genetic connectivity within Puget Sound and coastal Washington than between these two areas.},

abstract = {Understanding how genetic variation is partitioned across genomes within and among populations is a fundamental problem in ecological and evolutionary genetics. To address this problem, we studied the threespine stickleback fish, which has repeatedly undergone parallel phenotypic and genetic differentiation when oceanic fish have invaded freshwater habitats. While significant evolutionary genetic research has been performed using stickleback from geographic regions that have been deglaciated in the last 20 000 years, less research has focused on freshwater populations that predate the last glacial maximum. We performed restriction-site associated DNA-sequencing (RAD-seq) based population genomic analyses on stickleback from across Oregon, which was not glaciated during the last maximum. We sampled stickleback from coastal, Willamette Basin and central Oregon sites, analysed their genetic diversity using RAD-seq, performed structure analyses, reconstructed their phylogeographic history and tested the hypothesis of recent stickleback introduction into central Oregon, where incidence of this species was only recently documented. Our results showed a clear phylogeographic break between coastal and inland populations, with oceanic populations exhibiting the lowest levels of divergence from one another. Willamette Basin and central Oregon populations formed a clade of closely related populations, a finding consistent with a recent introduction of stickleback into central Oregon. Finally, genome-wide analysis of genetic diversity ($\pi$) and correlations of alleles within individuals in subpopulations (FIS) supported a role for introgressive hybridization in coastal populations and a recent expansion in central Oregon. Our results exhibit the power of next-generation sequencing genomic approaches such as RAD-seq to identify both historical population structure and recent colonization history.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous genetic divergence can accumulate across the genome when populations adapt to different habitats while still exchanging alleles. How long does diversification take and how much of the genome is affected? When divergence occurs in parallel from standing genetic variation, how often are the same haplotypes used? We explore these questions using RAD-seq genotyping data, and show that broad-scale genomic re-patterning, fueled by standing variation, can emerge in just dozens of generations in replicate natural populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). After the catastrophic 1964 Alaskan earthquake, marine stickleback colonized newly created ponds on seismically uplifted islands. We find that freshwater fish in these young ponds differ from their marine ancestors across the same genomic segments previously shown to have diverged in much older lake populations. Outside of these core divergent regions the genome shows no population structure across the ocean-freshwater divide, consistent with strong local selection acting in alternative environments on stickleback populations still connected by significant gene flow. Reinforcing this inference, a majority of divergent haplotypes that are at high frequency in ponds are shared across independent freshwater populations and are detectable, at low frequency, in the sea even across great geographic distances. Building upon previous work in this model species for population genomics, our data suggest that a long history of divergent selection and gene flow across stickleback in oceanic and freshwater habitats has created balanced polymorphism in large genomic blocks of alternatively adapted DNA sequences, ultimately stoking - and potentially channeling - rapid, parallel evolution.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical in maintaining a physical and metabolic barrier between the blood and the brain. The BBB consists of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) that line the brain vasculature and combine with astrocytes, neurons and pericytes to form the neurovascular unit. We hypothesized that astrocytes and neurons generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could induce BBB phenotypes in iPSC-derived BMECs, creating a robust multicellular human BBB model. To this end, iPSCs were used to form neural progenitor-like EZ-spheres, which were in turn differentiated to neurons and astrocytes, enabling facile neural cell generation. The iPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons induced barrier tightening in primary rat BMECs indicating their BBB inductive capacity. When co-cultured with human iPSC-derived BMECs, the iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes significantly elevated trans-endothelial electrical resistance, reduced passive permeability, and improved tight junction continuity in the BMEC cell population, while p-glycoprotein efflux transporter activity was unchanged. A physiologically relevant neural cell mixture of one neuron: three astrocytes yielded optimal BMEC induction properties. Finally, an isogenic multicellular BBB model was successfully demonstrated employing BMECs, astrocytes, and neurons from the same donor iPSC source. It is anticipated that such an isogenic facsimile of the human BBB could have applications in furthering understanding the cellular interplay of the neurovascular unit in both healthy and diseased humans.

abstract = {Over the last few decades, advances in molecular techniques have led to the detection of strong geographic population structure and cryptic speciation in many benthic marine taxa, even those with long-lived pelagic larval stages. Polychaete annelids, in particular, generally show a high degree of population divergence, especially in mitochondrial genes. Rarely have molecular studies confirmed the presence of 'cosmopolitan' species. The amphinomid polychaete Hermodice carunculata was long considered the sole species within its genus, with a reported distribution throughout the Atlantic and adjacent basins. However, recent studies have indicated morphological differences, primarily in the number of branchial filaments, between the East and West Atlantic populations; these differences were invoked to re-instate Hermodice nigrolineata, formerly considered a junior synonym of H. carunculata. We utilized sequence data from two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S rDNA) markers and one nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) marker to examine the genetic diversity of Hermodice throughout its distribution range in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Guinea. Our analyses revealed generally low genetic divergences among collecting localities and between the East and West Atlantic, although phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial data indicate the presence of a private lineage in the Mediterranean Sea. A re-evaluation of the number of branchial filaments confirmed differences between East and West Atlantic populations; however, the differences were not diagnostic and did not reflect the observed genetic population structure. Rather, we suspect that the number of branchial filaments is a function of oxygen saturation in the environment. Our results do not support the distinction between H. carunculata in the West Atlantic and H. nigrolineata in the East Atlantic. Instead, they re-affirm the older notion that H. carunculata is a cohesive species with a broad distribution across the Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Endemic to Antarctic ecosystems, the limpet Nacella (Patinigera) concinna (Strebel, 1908) is an abundant and dominant marine benthic invertebrate of the intertidal and shallow subtidal zone. In order to examine the phylogeographic pattern and historical demography of the species along the western Antarctic Peninsula, we amplified 663. bp of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I of 161 N. concinna specimens from five localities, as well as two specimens from South Georgia and Sub-Antarctic Marion Island. As two different morphotypes, one characterized by an elevated shell in the intertidal and the other by a flat one in the subtidal, have been recurrently reported for this species, we also compared intertidal and subtidal samples from two localities of King George Island (Admiralty and Fildes Bay) through geometric morphometric and genetic analyses. As a result, elliptic Fourier analyses on shell shape morphology detected highly significant differences between intertidal and subtidal morphotypes. In contrast, mtDNA analyses between these morphotypes did not detect statistical differences between them and support the hypothesis that subtidal and intertidal N. concinna forms correspond to be the same population unit. Genetic analyses depicted low levels of haplotypic and nucleotide diversity in N. concinna in all localities. Among populations, comparisons did not detect any genetic structure, supporting the existence of a single genetic unit along the western Antarctic Peninsula. A marked L-shaped distribution of pairwise differences and significant negative Tajima's D and Fu's FS indices suggest the existence of a recent demographic expansion of this species. Time estimations corrected by the "time dependency of molecular rate" hypothesis for this demographic event (7,500-22,000 years ago) fit well with the last glacial-interglacial transition period. Low levels of genetic diversity in N. concinna could reflect the dramatic effect of glacial periods on population sizes, especially in Antarctic species with narrow bathymetric ranges. Genetic similarities between South Georgia and Antarctic samples, as well as between Nacella delesserti (Philippi, 1849) and N. concinna (Strebel, 1908) fell within the range of intraspecific variation. The genetic proximity between sub-Antarctic N. delesserti and the Antarctic limpet could be explained through north-eastward long-distance dispersion events during the late Pleistocene. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Quaternary glaciations in Antarctica drastically modified geographical ranges and population sizes of marine benthic invertebrates and thus affected the amount and distribution of intraspecific genetic variation. Here, we present new genetic information in the Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna, a dominant Antarctic benthic species along shallow ice-free rocky ecosystems. We examined the patterns of genetic diversity and structure in this broadcast spawner along maritime Antarctica and from the peri-Antarctic island of South Georgia. Genetic analyses showed that N. concinna represents a single panmictic unit in maritime Antarctic. Low levels of genetic diversity characterized this population; its median-joining haplotype network revealed a typical star-like topology with a short genealogy and a dominant haplotype broadly distributed. As previously reported with nuclear markers, we detected significant genetic differentiation between South Georgia Island and maritime Antarctica populations. Higher levels of genetic diversity, a more expanded genealogy and the presence of more private haplotypes support the hypothesis of glacial persistence in this peri-Antarctic island. Bayesian Skyline plot and mismatch distribution analyses recognized an older demographic history in South Georgia. Approximate Bayesian computations did not support the persistence of N. concinna along maritime Antarctica during the last glacial period, but indicated the resilience of the species in peri-Antarctic refugia (South Georgia Island). We proposed a model of Quaternary Biogeography for Antarctic marine benthic invertebrates with shallow and narrow bathymetric ranges including (i) extinction of maritime Antarctic populations during glacial periods; (ii) persistence of populations in peri-Antarctic refugia; and (iii) recolonization of maritime Antarctica following the deglaciation process.},

abstract = {The evolutionary age of some of the hydrothermal vent taxa have recently become a highly debated issue. Vestimentiferan worms (= siboglinid polychaetes) in particular, have been claimed to be as old as 430 million years based on the occurrence of fossilized tubes resembling those of currently known Vestimentifera (Little et al., 1997), while other authors, based on molecular data, have claimed they must be younger than 100 million years old (Black et al., 1997; Halanych et al., 1998). One explanation for this apparent discrepancy might be that tubes, such as those found in the Silurian fossil vent communities, did not belong to vestimentiferans, but rather to other tube-dwelling polychaetes. However, it is also possible that the choice of the molecular clock used to estimate the age of the vestimentiferan radiation from the molecular data, was simply not appropriate. Opportunities to accurately calibrate molecular clocks are relatively rare and cannot be generalized to all genes nor to all taxa. Such an opportunity appeared during a phylogeographic study of the hydrothermal-vent ampharetid polychaete Amphisamytha galapagensis Zottoli, 1983, which is widely distributed in the Eastern Pacific (Chevaldonne et al., in prep.). Originally described from the Galapagos Rift, this worm was later found at most vent sites of the East Pacific Rise (EPR), but also on the northeastern Pacific ridge systems (Desbruyeres, 1997). However, our ongoing molecular studies suggest that specimens from the northeastern ridges (Gorda, Juan de Fuca and Explorer ridges) should be assigned to a new cryptic sister-species that is distinct from A. galapagensis but very closely related (Chevaldonn{\'{e}} et al., in prep.). These related worms occupy distinct ridge systems that formerly were part of the Farallon-Pacific Ridge, which was disrupted by subduction under the North-American Plate about 28.5 MYA (Atwater, 1989; Severinghaus {\&} Atwater, 1990). Thus, they provide a unique opportunity to investigate the processes that lead to allopatric speciation events between vent assemblages of both ridge systems (Tunnicliffe, 1988), and to calibrate the rate of molecular evolution in deep-sea annelids.},

abstract = {The biogeography of Iceland is controversial. Some authors believe that all Icelandic life originated after postglacial dispersal events (tabula rasa hypothesis), but others assume that some organisms survived the last glaciation in ice-free refugia. To extend existing knowledge of the freshwater biogeography of Iceland, we used a snail species, Radix balthica, as a model system. Based on a sample of 1,070 sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from Iceland and from islands of the British Isles and continental Europe, a distinct Icelandic lineage was discovered. To explain the origin of the Icelandic lineage, two alternative scenarios were proposed: (i) postglacial colonization followed by rapid divergence under an elevated mutation rate and (ii) ancient preglacial colonization with survival during multiple glacial events in geothermal refugia and slow divergence under a âstandard' mutation rate. The results of neutrality tests and mismatch analyses and the star-like shape of the network indicated a recent population expansion of this species in Iceland. The modeling results within an approximate Bayesian computation framework supported the tabula rasa scenario. Based on our findings, a Holocene origin for the Icelandic lineage of R. balthica was suggested, which evolved under a mean rate of 7.95 Ã 10â7 substitutions/site/year.},

abstract = {Sardines (Sardinops spp.) occupy temperate upwelling zones in the coastal regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including locations in Japan, California, Chile, Australia, and South Africa. East and West Pacific populations are separated by vast expanses of open ocean, and northern and southern hemisphere populations are separated by tropical waters which are lethal to sardines. The relative importance of these barriers has been the focus of a long- standing debate between vicariance and dispersal schools in biogeography. Comparisons of a 500 bp fragment of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region reveal strong geographic structuring of mtDNA lineages but shallow divergence both within and between regional populations. Regional populations are related to one another in a stepping-stone pattern, the apparent result of a series of Pleistocene dispersal events around the continental margins of the Indian- Pacific Basin. These mtDNA data, combined with an electrophoretic survey of variability at 34 nuclear loci (Grant and Leslie 1996), indicate that the five regional forms of Sardinops (considered separate taxa by most authorities) probably diverged within 500,000 years BP, a much shorter timeframe than predicted by vicariance models based on plate tectonics. High mtDNA haplotype diversity, coupled with an excess of rare alleles in the protein electrophoretic dataset, may indicate exponential growth from a small ancestral population. The mtDNA and allozyme data are concordant with climate records and fossil evidence in portraying regional populations as recent, unstable, and ephem- eral. Regional populations of sardines have probably been extinguished and recolonized over short evolutionary timescales in response to changes in climate and the oceanography of coastal upwelling zones.},

Changes in the population size of humans have been thoroughly investigated, and we review different methodologies of demographic reconstruction, specifically focusing on human bottlenecks. In addition to the classical approaches based on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) or based on linkage disequilibrium, we also review more recent approaches that utilize atypical shared genomic fragments, such as identical by descent or homozygous segments between or within individuals. Compared with methods based on the SFS, these methods are well suited for detecting recent bottlenecks. In general, all these various methods suffer from bias and dependencies on confounding factors such as population structure or poor specification of the mutational and recombination processes, which can affect the demographic reconstruction. With the exception of SFS-based methods, the effects of confounding factors on the inference methods remain poorly investigated. We conclude that an important step when investigating population size changes rests on validating the demographic model by investigating to what extent the fitted demographic model can reproduce the main features of the polymorphism data.},

Our method can be applied to arbitrarily complex models as the likelihood is estimated by coalescent simulations. Under simple scenarios, our method behaves similarly to a widely used diffusion-based method while showing better convergence properties. In addition, our approach can be applied to very complex models including as many as a dozen populations, and still retrieve parameters very accurately in a reasonable time. We apply our approach to estimate the past demography of four human populations for which non-coding whole genome diversity is available, estimating the degree of European admixture of a southwest African American population and that of a Kenyan population with an unsampled East African population. We also show the versatility of our framework by inferring the demographic history of African populations from SNP chip data with known ascertainment bias, and find a very old divergence time ({\textgreater}110 Ky) between Yorubas from Western Africa and Sans from Southern Africa.},

Publications over the past 15 years from the journals Ecology, Evolution and Molecular Ecology reveal that much of the research published under the molecular ecology banner is in fact evolutionary in nature, and that comparatively little ecological research incorporates molecular tools. This failure to more broadly utilize molecular techniques in ecology is alarming because several promising lines of ecological inquiry could benefit from molecular approaches.

This pivotal concept of population genetics has implications for species health, domestication, management and conservation. Levels of genetic diversity seem to vary greatly in natural populations and species, but the determinants of this variation, and particularly the relative influences of species biology and ecology versus population history, are still largely mysterious. Here we show that the diversity of a species is predictable, and is determined in the first place by its ecological strategy. We investigated the genome-wide diversity of 76 non-model animal species by sequencing the transcriptome of two to ten individuals in each species. The distribution of genetic diversity between species revealed no detectable influence of geographic range or invasive status but was accurately predicted by key species traits related to parental investment: long-lived or low-fecundity species with brooding ability were genetically less diverse than short-lived or highly fecund ones. Our analysis demonstrates the influence of long-term life-history strategies on species response to short-term environmental perturbations, a result with immediate implications for conservation policies.},

The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged â¥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event.

We found that the specialized smashing appendage arose after the spearing appendage â¼126 Ma (95{\%} CRI [174â87Â Ma]). Ancestral state reconstructions revealed that the most recent common ancestor of extant stomatopods had eyes with six midband rows of hexagonal ommatidia. Hexagonal ommatidia are interpreted as plesiomorphic in stomatopods, and this is consistent with the malacostracan ground-plan.

Similarly, neither the response of Puritz et al. nor our comments here provide sufficient space to thoroughly review RADseq. Nonetheless, here we address some key points that we find unclear or potentially misleading in their evaluation of techniques.},

abstract = {We are writing in response to the population and phylogenomics meeting review by Andrews {\&} Luikart (2014) entitled 'Recent novel approaches for population genomics data analysis'. Restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing has become a powerful and useful approach in molecular ecology, with several different published methods now available to molecular ecologists, none of which can be considered the best option in all situations. A{\&}L report that the original RAD protocol of Miller et al. (2007) and Baird et al. (2008) is superior to all other RAD variants because putative PCR duplicates can be identified (see Baxter et al. 2011), thereby reducing the impact of PCR artefacts on allele frequency estimates (Andrews {\&} Luikart 2014). In response, we (i) challenge the assertion that the original RAD protocol minimizes the impact of PCR artefacts relative to that of other RAD protocols, (ii) present additional biases in RADseq that are at least as important as PCR artefacts in selecting a RAD protocol and (iii) highlight the strengths and weaknesses of four different approaches to RADseq which are a representative sample of all RAD variants: the original RAD protocol (mbRAD, Miller et al. 2007; Baird et al. 2008), double digest RAD (ddRAD, Peterson et al. 2012), ezRAD (Toonen et al. 2013) and 2bRAD (Wang et al. 2012). With an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different RAD protocols, researchers can make a more informed decision when selecting a RAD protocol.},

abstract = {Timing divergence events allow us to infer the conditions under which biodiversity has evolved and gain important insights into the mechanisms driving evolution. Cichlid fishes are a model system for studying speciation and adaptive radiation, yet, we have lacked reliable timescales for their evolution. Phylogenetic reconstructions are consistent with cichlid origins prior to Gondwanan landmass fragmentation 121-165 MYA, considerably earlier than the first known fossil cichlids (Eocene). We examined the timing of cichlid evolution using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with geological estimates for the ages of 1) Gondwanan fragmentation and 2) cichlid fossils. Timescales of cichlid evolution derived from fossil-dated phylogenies of other bony fishes most closely matched those suggested by Gondwanan breakup calibrations, suggesting the Eocene origins and marine dispersal implied by the cichlid fossil record may be due to its incompleteness. Using Gondwanan calibrations, we found accumulation of genetic diversity within the radiating lineages of the African Lakes Malawi, Victoria and Barombi Mbo, and Palaeolake Makgadikgadi began around or after the time of lake basin formation. These calibrations also suggest Lake Tanganyika was colonized independently by the major radiating cichlid tribes that then began to accumulate genetic diversity thereafter. These results contrast with the widely accepted theory that diversification into major lineages took place within the Tanganyika basin. Together, this evidence suggests that ancient lake habitats have played a key role in generating and maintaining diversity within radiating lineages and also that lakes may have captured preexisting cichlid diversity from multiple sources from which adaptive radiations have evolved.},

abstract = {The European lobster is distributed throughout the south and western regions of the Norwegian coast. A previous lobster allozyme investigation (1993) in the Tysfjord region, north of the Arctic Circle demonstrated that the lobster population from this region was genetically different from lobster samples collected in other parts of Norway. More detailed investigation including supplementary extensive sampling and additional allozyme, microsatellite and mtDNA analyses are reported here. This investigation supports the genetic distinctness of the Tysfjord population and shows that this is mainly due to a reduction (60- 70{\%}) in gene diversity (observed heterozygosities and number of alleles) compared with lobsters from more southern regions. In addition to the Tysfjord region, the comprehensive sampling also included lobsters found in the adjacent Nordfolda fjord system. Genetic analyses provided evidence for significant differences between the lobster populations of Tysfjord and Nordfolda, even though they are separated by a coastal distance of only 142 km. The two populations were also different with regards to several biological characteristics such as body size. The genetic difference between these two geographically close populations is likely to be due to the local hydrological conditions, preventing larval dispersal between the fjord systems. Assessment of lobster abundance in the north-west region suggests that the sub-arctic lobster populations are geographically isolated$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The molecular clock presents a means of estimating evolutionary rates and timescales using genetic data. These estimates can lead to important insights into evolutionary processes and mechanisms, as well as providing a framework for further biological analyses. To deal with rate variation among genes and among lineages, a diverse range of molecular-clock methods have been developed. These methods have been imple- mented in various software packages and differ in their statistical properties, ability to handle different models of rate variation, capacity to incorporate various forms of cali- brating information and tractability for analysing large data sets. Choosing a suitable molecular-clock model can be a challenging exercise, but a number of model-selection techniques are available. In this review, we describe the different forms of evolution- ary rate heterogeneity and explain how they can be accommodated in molecular-clock analyses. We provide an outline of the various clock methods and models that are available, including the strict clock, local clocks, discrete clocks and relaxed clocks. Techniques for calibration and clock-model selection are also described, along with methods for handling multilocus data sets.

abstract = {In this paper we examine the phylogeny and biogeography of the temperate genera of the Ophiocomidae (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) which have an interesting asymmetrical anti-tropical distribution, with two genera (Ophiocomina and Ophiopteris) previously considered to have a separate species in both the North and South hemispheres, and the third (Clarkcoma) diversifying in the southern Australian/New Zealand region. Our phylogeny, generated from one mitochondrial and two nuclear markers, revealed that Ophiopteris is sister to a mixed Ophiocomina/. Clarkcoma clade. Ophiocomina was polyphyletic, with O. nigra and an undescribed species from the South Atlantic Ocean sister to a clade including Clarkcoma species and O. australis. The phylogeny also revealed a number of recently diverged lineages occurring within Clarkcoma, some of which are considered to be cryptic species due to the similarity in morphology combined with the apparent absence of interbreeding in a sympatric distribution, while the status of others is less certain. The phylogeny provides support for two transequatorial events in the group under study. A molecular clock analysis places both events in the middle to late Miocene. The analysis excludes a tectonic vicariance hypothesis for the antitropical distribution associated with the breakup of Pangaea and also excludes the hypothesis of more recent gene flow associated with Plio/Pleistocene glacial cycling. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite their perceived importance, omics-level studies have seldom been applied to this group of animals largely due to a paucity of genomic resources. Here, we report the first large-scale gene-associated marker development and evaluation for a bivalve mollusc, Chlamys farreri. More than 21,000 putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified from the C. farreri transcriptome. Primers and probes were designed and synthesized for 4500 SNPs, and 1492 polymorphic markers were successfully developed using a high-resolution melting genotyping platform. These markers are particularly suitable for population genomic analysis due to high polymorphism within and across populations, a low frequency of null alleles, and conformation to neutral expectations. Unexpectedly, high cross-species transferability was observed, suggesting that the transferable SNPs may largely represent ancestral genetic variations that have been preserved differentially among subfamilies of Pectinidae. Gene annotations were available for 73{\%} of the markers, and 65{\%} could be anchored to the recently released Pacific oyster genome. Large-scale association analysis revealed key candidate genes responsible for scallop growth regulation, and provided markers for further genetic improvement of C. farreri in breeding programmes.},

abstract = {The circulation of water masses in the northeastern North Atlantic Ocean has a strong influence on global climate owing to the northward transport of warm subtropical water to high latitudes. But the ocean circulation at depths below the reach of satellite observations is difficult to measure, and only recently have comprehensive, direct observations of whole ocean basins been possible. Here we present quantitative maps of the absolute velocities at two levels in the northeastern North Atlantic as obtained from acoustically tracked floats. We find that most of the mean flow transported northward by the Gulf Stream system at the thermocline level (about 600 m depth) remains within the subpolar region, and only relatively little enters the Rockall trough or the Nordic seas. Contrary to previous work, our data indicate that warm, saline water from the Mediterranean Sea reaches the high latitudes through a combination of narrow slope currents and mixing processes. At both depths under investigation, currents cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge preferentially over deep gaps in the ridge, demonstrating that sea-floor topography can constrain even upper-ocean circulation patterns.},

Variable forcing by the large-scale rotation of the wind leads to a modulation in the strength of the gyres and their interconnecting jets. This is seen in drifter and altimeter data. Currents are stronger during winter and during phases of high North Atlantic Oscillation Index. The exchanges between the North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas do not seem to be directly affected by this variable forcing. The narrow boundary currents and the intergyre jets are subject to instability, causing mesoscale current fluctuations, which contribute to the stirring and mixing of Polar and Atlantic water masses.},

Here we explore the phylogenetic relationships and the evolutionary history of Leptogorgia using the complete mitochondrial genomes of six Leptogorgia species from different localities in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and eastern Pacific as well as four other genera of Gorgoniidae and Plexauridae. Our mitogenomic analyses showed high inter-specific diversity, variable nucleotide substitution rates and, for some species, novel genomic features such as ORFs of unknown function. The phylogenetic analyses using complete mitogenomes and an extended mtMutS dataset recovered Leptogorgia as polyphyletic, and the species considered in the analyses were split into two defined groups corresponding to different geographic regions, namely the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic-Mediterranean. Our phylogenetic analysis based on mtMutS also showed a clear separation between the eastern Atlantic and South African Leptogorgia, suggesting the need of a taxonomic revision for these forms. A time-calibrated phylogeny showed that the separation of eastern Pacific and western Atlantic species started ca. 20 Mya and suggested a recent divergence for eastern Pacific species and for L. sarmentosa-L. capverdensis. Our results also revealed high inter-specific diversity among eastern Atlantic and South African species, highlighting a potential role of the geographical diversification processes and geological events occurring during the last 30 Ma in the Atlantic on the evolutionary history of these organisms.},

Ever since its inception in the late 1970s (11, 12) and mid-1980s (13), the field has sought to extend phylogenetic reasoningto the intraspecific level, and thereby build empirical and conceptual bridges be- tween the formerly separate disciplines of microevolu- tionary population genetics and macroevolutionary phylogenetics. In the early years, phylogeographers relied on data from restriction-site surveys of mito- chondrial (mt) DNA to draw inferences about population structure and historical demography, but stunning im- provements in molecular techniques (14, 15) and exten- sions of coalescent theory and other analytical methods (16) later broadened the field's scope dramatically (17). Phylogeographic perspectives have transformed aspects of population biology, biogeography, systematics, ecol- ogy, genetics, and biodiversity conservation. One aim of this colloquium was to bring together leading scientists to address the current state of phylogeography as the discipline enters its fourth decade. The broader goal was to update a wide audience on recent developments in phylogeographic research and their relevance to past accomplishments and future research directions.},

abstract = {Empirical phylogeographic studies have progressively sampled greater numbers of loci over time, in part motivated by theoretical papers showing that estimates of key demographic parameters improve as the number of loci increases. Recently, next-generation sequencing has been applied to questions about organismal history, with the promise of revolutionizing the field. However, no systematic assessment of how phylogeographic datasets have changed over time with respect to overall size and information content has been performed. Here, we quantify the changing nature of these genetic datasets over the past 20 years, focusing on papers published in Molecular Ecology. We found that the number of independent loci, the total number of alleles sampled, and the total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per dataset has improved over time, with particularly dramatic increases within the past five years. Interestingly, uniparentally-inherited organellar markers (e.g., animal mitochondrial and plant chloroplast DNA) continue to represent an important component of phylogeographic data. Single-species studies (cf. comparative studies) that focus on vertebrates (particularly fish and to some extent, birds) represent the gold standard of phylogeographic data collection. Based on the current trajectory seen in our survey data, forecast modelling indicated that the median number of SNPs per dataset for studies published by the end of the year 2016 may approach {\~{}}20,000. This survey provides baseline information for understanding the evolution of phylogeographic datasets, and underscores the fact that development of analytical methods for handling very large genetic datasets will be critical for facilitating growth of the field.

abstract = {Phylogeography, and its extensions into comparative phylogeography, have their roots in the layering of gene trees across geography, a paradigm that was greatly facilitated by the nonrecombining, fast evolution provided by animal mtDNA. As phylogeography moves into the era of next-generation sequencing, the specter of reticulation at several levels-within loci and genomes in the form of recombination and across populations and species in the form of introgression-has raised its head with a prominence even greater than glimpsed during the nuclear gene PCR era. Here we explore the theme of reticulation in comparative phylogeography, speciation analysis, and phylogenomics, and ask how the centrality of gene trees has fared in the next-generation era. To frame these issues, we first provide a snapshot of multilocus phylogeographic studies across the Carpentarian Barrier, a prominent biogeographic barrier dividing faunas spanning the monsoon tropics in northern Australia. We find that divergence across this barrier is evident in most species, but is heterogeneous in time and demographic history, often reflecting the taxonomic distinctness of lineages spanning it. We then discuss a variety of forces generating reticulate patterns in phylogeography, including introgression, contact zones, and the potential selection-driven outliers on next-generation molecular markers. We emphasize the continued need for demographic models incorporating reticulation at the level of genomes and populations, and conclude that gene trees, whether explicit or implicit, should continue to play a role in the future of phylogeography.},

abstract = {For three decades, comparative phylogeography has conceptually and methodologically relied on the concordance criterion for providing insights into the historical/biogeographic processes driving population genetic structure and divergence. Here we discuss how this emphasis, and the corresponding lack of methods for extracting information about biotic/intrinsic contributions to patterns of genetic variation, may bias our general understanding of the factors driving genetic structure. Specifically, this emphasis has promoted a tendency to attribute discordant phylogeographic patterns to the idiosyncracies of history, as well as an adherence to generic null expectations of concordance with reduced predictive power. We advocate that it is time for a paradigm shift in comparative phylogeography, especially given the limited utility of the concordance criterion as genomic data provide ever-increasing levels of resolution. Instead of adhering to the concordance-discordance dichotomy, comparative phylogeography needs to emphasize the contribution of taxon-specific traits that will determine whether concordance is a meaningful criterion for evaluating hypotheses or may predict discordant phylogeographic structure. Through reference to some case studies we illustrate how refined hypotheses based on taxon-specific traits can provide improved predictive frameworks to forecast species responses to climatic change or biogeographic barriers while gaining unique insights about the taxa themselves and their interactions with their environment. We outline a potential avenue toward a synthetic comparative phylogeographic paradigm that includes addressing some important conceptual and methodological challenges related to study design and application of model-based approaches for evaluating support of trait-based hypotheses under the proposed paradigm.},

abstract = {Genetic analyses of contemporary populations can be used to estimate the demographic histories of species within an ecological community. Comparison of these demographic histories can shed light on community responses to past climatic events. However, species experience different rates of molecular evolution, and this presents a major obstacle to comparative demographic analyses. We address this problem by using a Bayesian relaxed-clock method to estimate the relative evolutionary rates of 22 small mammal taxa distributed across northwestern North America. We found that estimates of the relative molecular substitution rate for each taxon were consistent across the range of sampling schemes that we compared. Using three different reference rates, we rescaled the relative rates so that they could be used to estimate absolute evolutionary timescales. Accounting for rate variation among taxa led to temporal shifts in our skyline-plot estimates of demographic history, highlighting both uniform and idiosyncratic evolutionary responses to directional climate trends for distinct ecological subsets of the small mammal community. Our approach can be used in evolutionary analyses of populations from multiple species, including comparative demographic studies.},

abstract = {The rate of change in DNA is an important parameter for understanding molecular evolution and hence for inferences drawn from studies of phylogeography and phylogenetics. Most rate calibrations for mitochondrial coding regions in marine species have been made from divergence dating for fossils and vicariant events older than 1-2 My and are typically 0.5-2{\%} per lineage per million years. Recently, calibrations made with ancient DNA (aDNA) from younger dates have yielded faster rates, suggesting that estimates of the molecular rate of change depend on the time of calibration, decaying from the instantaneous mutation rate to the phylogenetic substitution rate. aDNA methods for recent calibrations are not available for most marine taxa so instead we use radiometric dates for sea-level rise onto the Sunda Shelf following the Last Glacial Maximum (starting â¼18,000 years ago), which led to massive population expansions for marine species. Instead of divergence dating, we use a two-epoch coalescent model of logistic population growth preceded by a constant population size to infer a time in mutational units for the beginning of these expansion events. This model compares favorably to simpler coalescent models of constant population size, and exponential or logistic growth, and is far more precise than estimates from the mismatch distribution. Mean rates estimated with this method for mitochondrial coding genes in three invertebrate species are elevated in comparison to older calibration points (2.3-6.6{\%} per lineage per million years), lending additional support to the hypothesis of calibration time dependency for molecular rates.},

abstract = {Herbivores often move among spatially interspersed host plants, tracking high-quality resources through space and time. This dispersal is of particular interest for vectors of plant pathogens. Existing molecular tools to track such movement have yielded important insights, but often provide insufficient genetic resolution to infer spread at finer spatiotemporal scales. Here, we explore the use of Nextera-tagmented reductively-amplified DNA (NextRAD) sequencing to infer movement of a highly-mobile winged insect, the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), among host plants. The psyllid vectors the pathogen that causes zebra chip disease in potato (Solanum tuberosum), but understanding and managing the spread of this pathogen is limited by uncertainty about the insect's host plant(s) outside of the growing season. We identified 1,978 polymorphic loci among psyllids separated spatiotemporally on potato or in patches of bittersweet nightshade (S. dulcumara), a weedy plant proposed to be the source of potato-colonizing psyllids. A subset of the psyllids on potato exhibited genetic similarity to insects on nightshade, consistent with regular movement between these two host plants. However, a second subset of potato-collected psyllids was genetically distinct from those collected on bittersweet nightshade; this suggests that a currently unrecognized source, i.e., other nightshade patches or a third host-plant species, could be contributing to psyllid populations in potato. Oftentimes, dispersal of vectors of pathogens must be tracked at a fine scale in order to understand, predict, and manage disease spread. We demonstrate that emerging sequencing technologies that detect genomewide SNPs of a vector can be used to infer such localized movement. {\textcopyright} 2017 Fu et al.

abstract = {Molecular dating of phylogenetic trees is a growing discipline using sequence data to co-estimate the timing of evolutionary events and rates of molecular evolution. All molecular-dating methods require converting genetic divergence between sequences into absolute time. Historically, this could only be achieved by associating externally derived dates obtained from fossil or biogeographical evidence to internal nodes of the tree. In some cases, notably for fast-evolving genomes such as viruses and some bacteria, the timespan over which samples were collected may cover a significant proportion of the time since they last shared a common ancestor. This situation allows phylogenetic trees to be calibrated by associating sampling dates directly to the sequences representing the tips (terminal nodes) of the tree. The increasing availability of genomic data from ancient DNA extends the applicability of such tip-based calibration to a variety of taxa including humans, extinct megafauna and various micro-organisms which typically have a scarce fossil record. The development of statistical models accounting for heterogeneity in different aspects of the evolutionary process while accommodating very large datasets (e.g. whole genomes) has allowed using tip-dating methods to reach inferences on divergence times, substitution rates, past demography or the age of specific mutations on a variety of spatio-temporal scales. In this review, we summarize the current state-of-the-art of tip-dating, discuss some recent applications, highlight common pitfalls and provide a "how to" guide to thoroughly perform such analyses.

The implications of this are powerful, potentially reshaping our view of how climate history impacts upon both species distribution patterns and the geographic structuring of genetic variation within species. However, our assessment of the hypothesis reveals a lack of theoretical support and empirical evidence for hypothesized magnitudes of timedependent rates of molecular evolution, with much of the apparent rate changes coming from artefacts and biases inherent in the methods of rate estimation. Our assessment also reveals a problem with how serial sampling is implemented for mutation rate estimation using ancient DNA samples, rendering published estimates unreliable.},

abstract = {Despite the deep sea being the largest habitat on Earth, there are just 77 population genetic studies of invertebrates (115 species) inhabiting non-chemosynthetic ecosystems on the deep-sea floor (below 200Â m depth). We review and synthesize the results of these papers. Studies reveal levels of genetic diversity comparable to shallow-water species. Generally, populations at similar depths were well connected over 100sâ1,000sÂ km, but studies that sampled across depth ranges reveal population structure at much smaller scales (100sâ1,000sÂ m) consistent with isolation by adaptation across environmental gradients, or the existence of physical barriers to connectivity with depth. Few studies were ocean-wide (under 4{\%}), and 48{\%} were Atlantic-focused. There is strong emphasis on megafauna and commercial species with research into meiofauna, âecosystem engineersâ and other ecologically important species lacking. Only nine papers account for {\~{}}50{\%} of the planet's surface (depths below 3,500Â m). Just two species were studied below 5,000Â m, a quarter of Earth's seafloor. Most studies used single-locus mitochondrial genes revealing a common pattern of non-neutrality, consistent with demographic instability or selective sweeps; similar to deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna. The absence of a clear difference between vent and non-vent could signify that demographic instability is common in the deep sea, or that selective sweeps render single-locus mitochondrial studies demographically uninformative. The number of population genetics studies to date is miniscule in relation to the size of the deep sea. The paucity of studies constrains meta-analyses where broad inferences about deep-sea ecology could be made. },

abstract = {Despite a long-standing debate about the utility of species-centered conservation approaches (Roberge {\&} Angelstam 2004), surrogate species remain popular by providing useful-or even necessary-"shortcuts" for successful conservation programs (Caro 2010). Flagship species, as one prime example of surrogates, are primarily intended to promote public awareness and to raise funds for conservation (Ver{\'{i}}ssimo etÂ al. 2011). In contrast, the protection of umbrella species is expected to benefit a wide range of co-occurring species (Roberge {\&} Angelstam 2004; Caro 2010). Accordingly, the main criteria for selecting flagships should be based on socio-cultural considerations, whereas umbrellas are principally chosen based on ecological criteria (Caro 2010; Ver{\'{i}}ssimo etÂ al. 2011; see Table 1). Since these two concepts are often confused or mistakenly used interchangeably, Caro (2010, p. 248) coined the term "flagship umbrellas" for those species that explicitly integrate both functions. Indeed, Li and Pimm (2016) recently demonstrated that the classic flagship species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), can simultaneously act as an umbrella species, as its protection benefits many co-occurring endemic mammals, birds and amphibians. This challenges the often held views that: (i) the umbrella concept has to be abandoned as it is not efficiently working at local scales (Caro 2015); (ii) most flagship species are weak predictors for efficient reserve planning (Caro 2010); and (iii) ecosystem- or landscape-based conservation approaches should consequentially be favored over species-based approaches whenever feasible (Roberge {\&} Angelstam 2004; Caro 2010). Further commotion in the discussion is the increasingly demanded paradigm shift in conservation strategies to specifically target hidden or neglected biodiversity for its intrinsic value and its contribution to ecosystem processes (Dougherty etÂ al. 2016).

We used the COI barcoding gene to screen samples of tuna, eel, and a variety of other products characterised by less visually distinctive âwhite flesh'. Moderate levels of substitution were found (10{\%}), significantly lower than observed in North America, which lends support to the argument that public awareness, policy and governance of seafood labels is more effective in the European Union. Nevertheless, the results highlight that current labelling practice in UK restaurants lags behind the level of detail implemented in the retail sector, which hinders consumer choice, with potentially damaging economic, health and environmental consequences. Specifically, critically endangered species of tuna and eel continue to be sold without adequate information to consumers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Three important components have come together: efficient techniques to examine informative segments of DNA, statistics to analyse DNA data and the availability of easy-to-use computer packages. Single-locus genetic markers and those that produce gene genealogies yield information that is truly comparable among studies. These markers answer biological questions most efficiently and also contribute to much broader investigations of evolutionary, population and conservation biology. For these reasons, single-locus and genealogical markers should be the focus of the intensive genetic data collection that has begun owing to the power of genetics in population biology.},

abstract = {Thirty years of industrial fishing have led to overexploitation of many species, triggering the urgent need to better assess and manage marine stocks for sustainability. From the very simple definition of stock as "an exploited fishery unit" to its complex delimitation using ecosystem approaches, genetic approaches provide a large number of potential markers to unveil the underlying molecular background of complex biological phenomena in marine species.The present study is a diagnostic assessment of the number of scientific data published in marine fisheries using genetic technologies since the onset of NGS up to 2014. This state of the art approach would allow to derive causalities of real figures and to hypothesize trends in the use and applications of genetic markers. We first briefly overview pros and cons of current technologies used to delineate fish stocks and address intrapopulation knowledge deficits identified under an open population paradigm. Then, in order to assess the advancement of the application of molecular genetic techniques in "fish stock delineation" we review the work published on spatio-temporal structures of fish stocks. Finally, the datamining effort is enlarged across marine fisheries during the period 2004-20014 to decipher the intensity of use of genetic tools per taxa, the main application of each marker type and the trend of use of classic, modern and new generation techniques in fishery research tasks. Although microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA-based markers have being used at a growing pace in fishery research tasks until 2011, a time when application of gene sequencing and NGS-derived markers to fishery research has significantly grown. NGS technologies are underused in fishery science regarding their wide application in other research fields such as agriculture and aquaculture. So a significant increment of new genetic marker types is expected to be implemented in the near future. Conversely, application of classic marker types such as allozymes, AFLPs, whole mitochondrial genomes, RAPDs and RFLPs on mtDNA has been much less used in the period 2004-2014 following the advent of fast and cheap genotypic screening and NGS-derived markers. Power gain afforded from the combination of different genetic markers to address complex processes is lacking in current fishery research since only 21{\%} of the studies over that period employed two genetic marker types and only 3{\%} employed more than two.Combinations of methods would allow addressing management issues such as distribution shifts and population expansion in response to climatic fluctuations and global change, as well as overfishing and fishery collapses.},

abstract = {The FAO estimates that 80{\%} of marine fish stocks are fully or overexploited worldwide. Illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing contributes vastly to this condition, and poses a severe threat to marine ecosystems. Controlling for compliance and enforcing fishing regulations is hampered by difficulties in identifying the geographic origin of fish and fish products, at point of landing and further down the food supply chain. While forensic genetic species identification methods are routinely employed to investigate commercial fraud, there are at present no validated methods for identifying the geographic origin of marine fish. FishPopTrace is an international project, funded by the EU framework programme (FP7), aiming to generate forensically validated panels of SNP markers for geographic origin assignment in four commercially important fish species, cod (Gadus morhua), hake (Merluccius merluccius), herring (Clupea harengus) and common sole (Solea solea). 454-sequencing with sample tagging is employed to generate large numbers of population informative candidate SNP loci in each species. Selected SNPs are subsequently genotyped using Illumina 1536-arrays across populations to provide high resolution maps of genetic variation. Panels comprising subsets of these markers will ultimately be validated for traceability and enforcement applications. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.Effective conservation and management of migratory species requires accurate identification of unique populations, even as they mix along their migratory corridors. While telemetry has historically been used to study migratory animal movement and habitat use patterns, genomic tools are emerging as a superior alternative in many ways, allowing large-scale application at reduced costs. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of genomic resources for identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that allow fast and accurate identification of the imperiled Chinook salmon in the Great Central Valley of California. We show that 80 well-chosen loci, drawn from a pool of over 11,500 SNPs developed from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, can accurately identify Chinook salmon runs and select populations within run. No other SNP panel for Central Valley Chinook salmon has been able to achieve the high accuracy of assignment we show here. This panel will greatly improve our ability to study and manage this ecologically, economically, and socially important species and demonstrates the great utility of using genomics to study migratory species.},

abstract = {Networks of marine reserves are increasingly being promoted as a means of conserving marine biodiversity. One consideration in designing systems of marine reserves is the maintenance of connectivity to ensure the long-term persistence and resilience of populations. Knowledge of connectivity, however, is frequently lacking during marine reserve design and establishment. We characterise patterns of genetic connectivity of 3 key species of habitat-forming macroalgae across an established network of temperate marine reserves on the east coast of Australia and the implications for adaptive management and marine reserve design. Connectivity varied greatly among species. Connectivity was high for the subtidal macroalgae Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa and neither species showed any clear patterns of genetic structuring with geographic distance within or among marine parks. In contrast, connectivity was low for the intertidal, Hormosira banksii, and there was a strong pattern of isolation by distance. Coastal topography and latitude influenced small scale patterns of genetic structure. These results suggest that some species are well served by the current system of marine reserves in place along this temperate coast but it may be warranted to revisit protection of intertidal habitats to ensure the long-term persistence of important habitat-forming macroalgae. Adaptively managing marine reserve design to maintain connectivity may ensure the long-term persistence and resilience of marine habitats and the biodiversity they support.},

abstract = {Double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) and target capture sequencing methods are used to explore population and phylogenetic questions in non-model organisms. ddRADseq offers a simple and reliable protocol for population genomic studies, however it can result in a large amount of missing data due to allelic dropout. Target capture sequencing offers an opportunity to increase sequencing coverage with little missing data and consistent orthologous loci across samples, although this approach has generally been applied to conserved markers for deeper evolutionary questions. Here, we combine both methods to generate high quality sequencing data for population genomic studies of all marine lobster species from the genus Jasus. We designed probes based on ddRADseq libraries of two lobster species (Jasus edwardsii and Sagmariasus verreauxi) and evaluated the captured sequencing data in five other Jasus species. We validated 4,465 polymorphic loci amongst these species using a cost effective sequencing protocol, of which 1,730 were recovered from all species, and 4,026 were present in at least three species. The method was also successfully applied to DNA samples obtained from museum specimens. This data will be further used to assess spatial-temporal genetic variation in Jasus species found in the Southern Hemisphere. Target enriched, or target-capture next-generation sequencing, has been successfully applied to assess genome-scale data in non-model species lacking a reference genome. The method uses 60-to 120-mer probes for in-solution hybridization to capture specific genome targets for sequencing. This approach has proven to be useful in addressing phylogenetic questions (reviewed by McCormack 1},

abstract = {Understanding the boundaries of breeding populations is of great importance for conservation efforts and estimates of extinction risk for threatened species. However, determining these boundaries can be difficult when population structure is subtle. Emperor penguins are highly reliant on sea ice, and some populations may be in jeopardy as climate change alters sea ice extent and quality. An understanding of emperor penguin population structure is therefore urgently needed. Two previous studies have differed in their conclusions, particularly whether the Ross Sea, a major stronghold for the species, is isolated or not. We assessed emperor penguin population structure using 4,596 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterised in 110 individuals (10 â 16 per colony) from eight colonies around Antarctica. In contrast to a previous conclusion that emperor penguins are panmictic around the entire continent, we find that emperor penguins comprise at least four metapopulations, and that the Ross Sea is clearly a distinct metapopulation. By using larger sample sizes and a thorough assessment of the limitations of different analytical methods, we have shown that population structure within emperor penguins does exist and argue that its recognition is vital for the effective conservation of the species. We discuss the many difficulties that molecular ecologists and managers face in the detection and interpretation of subtle population structure using large SNP datasets, and argue that subtle structure should be taken into account when determining management strategies for threatened species, until accurate estimates of demographic connectivity among populations can be made.},

abstract = {The UK network of Marine Protected Areas and the application of management measures to protect conservation features has grown over the past decade. Bodies that regulate activities within MPAs require advice from âstatutory' conservation bodies. Therefore to assess the developing MPA networks resilience it is important to assess the ability of bodies to provide effective conservation advice. Thus âNatural England' officers were interviewed to assess their ability to provide scientific advice on the impacts of operations in English MPAs. Results highlight the opinions of UK statutory conservation advisors to be able to provide concrete evidence on the impact of MPA designations and management measures. Response scores were ranked from 1 to 5, with 1 representing a low score, and 5, high. For governance, there was a very positive response to the structures in place to provide conservation advice (4.5). However, in terms of the finance available to provide adequate scientific advice, responses scored lower at 3.1. The majority of NE respondents believe the budget available for âfeature condition assessment' to be insufficient for the current MPA network, with most advice derived from âexpert judgement' based on the precautionary principle rather than site-based observation of âcause-and-effect' from different human activities. Yet although budgets are a problem, the relationship between Natural England and local fisheries regulators is very healthy, resulting in better joined-up communication over management measures applied to stakeholders. Hence this research recommends the development of private-public partnerships (co-management initiatives) to reduce costs, bring in affected stakeholders and their assets, and improve trust.},

abstract = {Speciation, the evolution of reproductive isolation among populations, is continuous, complex, and involves multiple, interacting barriers. Until it is complete, the effects of this process vary along the genome and can lead to a heterogeneous genomic landscape with peaks and troughs of differentia- tion and divergence. When gene flow occurs during speciation, barriers restricting gene flow locally in the genome lead to patterns of heterogeneity. However, genomic heterogeneity can also be produced or modified by varia- tion in factors such as background selection and selective sweeps, recombi- nation and mutation rate variation, and heterogeneous gene density. Extracting the effects of gene flow, divergent selection and reproductive iso- lation from such modifying factors presents a major challenge to speciation genomics. We argue one of the principal aims of the field is to identify the barrier loci involved in limiting gene flow. We first summarize the expected signatures of selection at barrier loci, at the genomic regions linked to them and across the entire genome. We then discuss the modifying factors that complicate the interpretation of the observed genomic landscape. Finally, we end with a road map for future speciation research: a proposal for how to account for these modifying factors and to progress towards understand- ing the nature of barrier loci. Despite the difficulties of interpreting empirical data, we argue that the availability of promising technical and analytical methods will shed further light on the important roles that gene flow and divergent selection have in shaping the genomic landscape of speciation.

abstract = {Past events like fluctuations in population size and post-glacial colonization processes may influence the relative importance of genetic drift, migration and selection when determining the present day patterns of genetic variation. We disentangle how drift, selection and migration shape neutral and adaptive genetic variation in 12 moor frog populations along a 1700Â km latitudinal gradient. We studied genetic differentiation and variation at a MHC exon II locus and a set of 18 microsatellites. Using outlier analyses, we identified the MHC II exon 2 (corresponding to the $\beta$-2 domain) locus and one microsatellite locus (RCO8640) to be subject to diversifying selection, while five microsatellite loci showed signals of stabilizing selection among populations. STRUCTURE and DAPC analyses on the neutral microsatellites assigned populations to a northern and a southern cluster, reflecting two different post-glacial colonization routes found in previous studies. Genetic variation overall was lower in the northern cluster. The signature of selection on MHC exon II was weaker in the northern cluster, possibly as a consequence of smaller and more fragmented populations. Our results show that historical demographic processes combined with selection and drift have led to a complex pattern of differentiation along the gradient where some loci are more divergent among populations than predicted from drift expectations due to diversifying selection, while other loci are more uniform among populations due to stabilizing selection. Importantly, both overall and MHC genetic variation are lower at northern latitudes. Due to lower evolutionary potential, the low genetic variation in northern populations may increase the risk of extinction when confronted with emerging pathogens and climate change.},

These measures are variants of FST, a standardized measure of the genetic variance among populations, and are used to solve for Nm, the number of migrants successfully entering a population per generation. Unfortunately, the mathematical model underlying this translation makes many biologically unrealistic assumptions; real populations are very likely to violate these assumptions, such that there is often limited quantitative information to be gained about dispersal from using gene frequency data. While studies of genetic structure per se are often worthwhile, and FST is an excellent measure of the extent of this population structure, it is rare that FST can be translated into an accurate estimate of Nm.},

abstract = {Genome scans with many genetic markers provide the opportunity to investigate local adaptation in natural populations and identify candidate genes under selection. In particular, SNPs are dense throughout the genome of most organisms and are commonly observed in functional genes making them ideal markers to study adaptive molecular variation. This approach has become commonly employed in ecological and population genetics studies to detect outlier loci that are putatively under selection. However, there are several challenges to address with outlier approaches including genotyping errors, underlying population structure and false positives, variation in mutation rate and limited sensitivity (false negatives). In this study, we evaluated multiple outlier tests and their type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) error rates in a series of simulated data sets. Comparisons included simulation procedures (FDIST2, ARLEQUIN v.3.5 and BAYESCAN) as well as more conventional tools such as global F(ST) histograms. Of the three simulation methods, FDIST2 and BAYESCAN typically had the lowest type II error, BAYESCAN had the least type I error and Arlequin had highest type I and II error. High error rates in Arlequin with a hierarchical approach were partially because of confounding scenarios where patterns of adaptive variation were contrary to neutral structure; however, Arlequin consistently had highest type I and type II error in all four simulation scenarios tested in this study. Given the results provided here, it is important that outlier loci are interpreted cautiously and error rates of various methods are taken into consideration in studies of adaptive molecular variation, especially when hierarchical structure is included.},

abstract = {We introduce the R package pcadapt that performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. The statistical method implemented in pcadapt assumes that markers excessively related with population structure are candidates for local adaptation. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis (PCA), the package is fast and can handle large-scale data generated with next-generation technologies. It can also handle missing data as well as data obtained from pooled sequencing. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package can handle admixed individuals and does not require to group individuals into predefined populations. Using data simulated under an island model, a divergence model and range expansion, we compare pcadapt to other software performing genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). For the different software, the average proportion of false discoveries is around the nominal false discovery rate set at 10{\%} with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40{\%} of false discoveries. When comparing statistical power for a realized percentage of false discoveries, we find that the power of BayeScan can be severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we show that pcadapt is the most powerful method in a model of range expansion where population structure is continuous. Because pcadapt can handle molecular data generated with next sequencing technologies, we anticipate that it will be a valuable tool for modern analysis in molecular ecology.},

We explore several issues important to interpretation of the results and quantify the bias in estimates of contemporary Ne associated with the assumption that all loci in a large SNP data set are unlinked.

abstract = {Understanding how geography, oceanography, and climate have ultimately shaped marine biodiversity requires aligning the distri- butions of genetic diversity across multiple taxa. Here, we examine phylogeographic partitions in the sea against a backdrop of bio- geographic provinces defined by taxonomy, endemism, and species composition. The taxonomic identities used to define biogeographic provinces are routinely accompanied by diagnostic genetic differences between sister species, indicating interspecific concordance between biogeography and phylogeography. In cases where individual species are distributed across two or more biogeographic provinces, shifts in genotype frequencies often align with biogeographic boundaries, providing intraspecific concordance between biogeography and phylogeography. Here, we provide examples of comparative phy- logeography from (i) tropical seas that host the highest marine biodiversity, (ii) temperate seas with high productivity but volatile coastlines, (iii) migratory marine fauna, and (iv) plankton that are the most abundant eukaryotes on earth. Tropical and temperate zones both show impacts of glacial cycles, the former primarily through changing sea levels, and the latter through coastal habitat disruption. The general concordance between biogeography and phylogeography indicates that the population-level genetic diver- gences observed between provinces are a starting point for mac- roevolutionary divergences between species. However, isolation between provinces does not account for all marine biodiversity; the remainder arises through alternative pathways, such as eco- logical speciation and parapatric (semiisolated) divergences within provinces and biodiversity hotspots.},

Genetics and the conservation of natural populations: allozymes to genomes. Molecular Ecology 26:420â430. DOI: 10.1111/mec.13948.llozymes in the 1970s pro-vided the first estimates of the amount of genetic varia-tion within and between natural populations at multiple loci. These early studies played an important role in developing plans to conserve species. The description of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA in the early 1980s laid the foundation for the field of phylogeography, which provided a deeper look in time of the relation-ships and connectivity among populations. The develop-ment of microsatellites in the 1990s provided much more powerful means to describe genetic variation at nuclear loci, including the ability to detect past bottlenecks and estimate current effective population size with a single temporal sample. In the 2000s, single nucleotide polymor-phisms presented a cornucopia of loci that has greatly improved power to estimate genetic and population demographic parameters important for conservation. Today, population genomics presents the ability to detect regions of the genome that are affected by natural selec-tion (e.g. local adaptation or inbreeding depression). In addition, the ability to genotype historical samples has provided power to understand how climate change and other anthropogenic phenomena have affected popula-tions. Modern molecular techniques provide unprece-dented power to understand genetic variation in natural populations. Nevertheless, application of this information requires sound understanding of population genetics the-ory. I believe that current training in conservation genet-ics focuses too much on the latest techniques and too little on understanding the conceptual basis which is needed to interpret these data and ask good questions. The first two papers describing genetic variation at multi-ple loci in natural populations were published some 50 years ago (Harris 1966; Lewontin {\&} Hubby 1966). The rush was on to describe genetic variation in as many spe-cies as possible species using protein electrophoresis. The term allozyme was introduced in 1969 to refer to allelic forms at the same protein-coding locus detected with elec-trophoresis (Prakash et al. 1969). Those were exciting times when it first became possible to detect and compare the amount of genetic variation at many loci in any species, from E. coli to elephants. Charlesworth {\&} Charlesworth (2017) have provided an overview of the theoretical and empirical advances in population genetics over this 50-year period which complements this consideration of the appli-cations of population genetics to conservation. The absence of empirical data on the amount of genetic variation within and among populations had wide implica-tions for other central problems in ecology and evolution. Ehrlich {\&} Raven (1969) proposed that gene flow in natural populations is highly restricted and that natural selection is the 'primary cohesive and disruptive force in evolution'. They proposed that natural selection, rather than gene flow, determines the amount of differentiation among pop-ulations. The study of allozymes made it possible for the first time to test empirically the rich body of population genetics theory that had been developed in the previous 50 years by such intellectual giants as R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright. How much genetic variation is there in natural populations? Do large populations con-tain more genetic variation than small populations? How genetically divergent are populations in the same species? Early results made it clear that the 'classical' view that most individuals are homozygous for a single wild-type allele at most loci was incorrect (Lewontin 1974). However, the debate raged for years whether the surprising amount of genetic variation detected with allozymes was main-tained primarily by some form of balancing selection or a combination of neutral mutations and genetic drift (King {\&} Jukes 1969; Kimura 1983; Nei 2005). A prescient paper by Kimura {\&} Crow (1964) proposed the possibility that the 'wild-type' allele may in fact be comprised of many nearly identical alleles ('isoalleles') with little effect on fitness. In this essay, I consider how this ability to detect and describe genetic variation in natural populations has influ-enced efforts to conserve natural populations. Frankel (1974) was the first to argue that the principles of genetics should be applied to the conservation of species. The field of conserva-tion genetics has matured, and it has come to play an essential role in the conservation and management of species. My career began in 1971 and has spanned the period beginning when there was virtually no understanding of the amount of allele frequency divergence in natural populations to the pre-sent when data are available from complete genome sequenc-ing of many individuals in a variety of species.},

In addition to the calculation of differentiation measures, mmod can produce parametric bootstrap and jackknife samples of data sets for further analysis.

A key step in any genomics analysis, such as high-throughput sequencing, is the availability of sufficient and high quality DNA. Although commercial kits exist to extract genomic DNA from several species, preparation of high quality DNA from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Daphnia{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} spp. and other chitinous species can be challenging. Here, we optimise methods for tissue homogenisation, DNA extraction and quantification customised for different downstream analyses (e.g., LC-MS/MS, Hiseq, mate pair sequencing or Nanopore). We demonstrate that if {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Daphnia magna{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} are homogenised as whole animals (including the carapace), absorbance-based DNA quantification methods significantly over-estimate the amount of DNA, resulting in using insufficient starting material for experiments, such as preparation of sequencing libraries. This is attributed to the high refractive index of chitin in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Daphnia's{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} carapace at 260 nm. Therefore, unless the carapace is removed by overnight proteinase digestion, the extracted DNA should be quantified with fluorescence-based methods. However, overnight proteinase digestion will result in partial fragmentation of DNA therefore the prepared DNA is not suitable for downstream methods that require high molecular weight DNA, such as PacBio, mate pair sequencing and Nanopore. In conclusion, we found that the MasterPure DNA purification kit, coupled with grinding of frozen tissue, is the best method for extraction of high molecular weight DNA as long as the extracted DNA is quantified with fluorescence-based methods. This method generated high yield and high molecular weight DNA (3.10 Â± 0.63 ng/Âµg dry mass, fragments {\textgreater}60 kb), free of organic contaminants (phenol, chloroform) and is suitable for large number of downstream analyses. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Northeast coral gardens provide vital breeding and feeding habitats for fishes of conservation and commercial importance. Such habitats are increasingly at risk of destruction as a result of over fishing, ocean warming, acidification and marine litter. A key cause for concern regarding the vulnerability of coral gardens to damage from any source is their slow growth rate, and thereby their ability to recover from damage. Hence protected areas are being put in place, which exclude the use of towed demersal fishing gear. Citizen scientists observed that gorgonian coral (Pink Sea Fans) skeletons were stranding on beaches entangled in marine debris (sea fangles) across southwest England. Further, SCUBA divers reported that gorgonian corals were being caught up and damaged in lost fishing gear and other marine litter. To determine the cause of the damage to coral gardens, sea fangles were collected and analysed. The sea fangles were made up of a diverse range of litter from fishing and domestic sources, however, the majority comprised of fishing gear (P{\textless}0.05). Marine Protected Areas can protect coral gardens from direct fishing pressure, but risks still remain from ghost fishing pressure, demonstrating the need for sources of litter into the environment to be reduced and existing litter removed. The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) outlines targets for marine litter by 2020. This study highlights the importance of adhering to the MSFD and/or creating more ambitious regulation if the UK re-write existing legislation following BREXIT.},

abstract = {Reproducibility is the benchmark for results and conclusions drawn from scientific studies, but systematic studies on the reproducibility of scientific results are surprisingly rare. Moreover, many modern statistical methods make use of 'random walk' model fitting procedures, and these are inherently stochastic in their output. Does the combination of these statistical procedures and current standards of data archiving and method reporting permit the reproduction of the authors' results? To test this, we reanalysed data sets gathered from papers using the software package STRUCTURE to identify genetically similar clusters of individuals. We find that reproducing structure results can be difficult despite the straightforward requirements of the program. Our results indicate that 30{\%} of analyses were unable to reproduce the same number of population clusters. To improve this, we make recommendations for future use of the software and for reporting STRUCTURE analyses and results in published works. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Assessments of population genetic structure have become an increasing focus as they can provide valuable insight into patterns of migration and gene flow. STRUCTURE, the most highly cited of several clustering-based methods, was developed to provide robust estimates without the need for populations to be determined a priori. STRUCTURE introduces the problem of selecting the optimal number of clusters and as a result the $\Delta$K method was proposed to assist in the identification of the âtrue' number of clusters. In our review of 1,264 studies using STRUCTURE to explore population subdivision, studies that used $\Delta$K were more likely to identify K=2 (54{\%}, 443/822) than studies that did not use $\Delta$K (21{\%}, 82/386). A troubling finding was that very few studies performed the hierarchical analysis recommended by the authors of both $\Delta$K and STRUCTURE to fully explore population subdivision. Furthermore, extensions of earlier simulations indicate that, with a representative number of markers, $\Delta$K frequently identifies K=2 as the top level of hierarchical structure, even when more subpopulations are present. This review suggests that many studies may have been over- or underestimating population genetic structure; both scenarios have serious consequences, particularly with respect to conservation and management. We recommend publication standards for population structure results so that readers can assess the implications of the results given their own understanding of the species biology.},

abstract = {1. The tempo and mode of adaptive evolution determine how natural selection shapes patterns of genetic diversity in DNA polymorphism data. While slow mutation-limited adaptation leads to classical footprints of âhardâ selective sweeps, these patterns are different when adaptation responds quickly to a novel selection pressure, acting either on standing genetic variation or on recurrent new mutation. In the past decade, corresponding footprints of âsoftâ selective sweeps have been described both in theoretical models and in empirical data. 2. Here, we summarize the key theoretical concepts and contrast model predictions with observed patterns in Drosophila , humans, and microbes. 3. Evidence in all cases shows that âsoftâ patterns of rapid adaptation are frequent. However, theory and data also point to a role of complex adaptive histories in rapid evolution. 4. While existing theory allows for important implications on the tempo and mode of the adaptive process, complex footprints observed in data are, as yet, insufficiently covered by models. They call for in-depth empirical study and further model development.},

@article{Suchan2016,
abstract = {In the recent years, many protocols aimed at reproducibly sequencing reduced-genome subsets in non-model organisms have been published. Among them, RAD-sequencing is one of the most widely used. It relies on digesting DNA with specific restriction enzymes and performing size selection on the resulting fragments. Despite its acknowledged utility, this method is of limited use with degraded DNA samples, such as those isolated from museum specimens, as these samples are less likely to harbor fragments long enough to comprise two restriction sites making possible ligation of the adapter sequences (in the case of double-digest RAD) or performing size selection of the resulting fragments (in the case of single-digest RAD). Here, we address these limitations by presenting a novel method called hybridization RAD (hyRAD). In this approach, biotinylated RAD fragments, covering a random fraction of the genome, are used as baits for capturing homologous fragments from genomic shotgun sequencing libraries. This simple and cost-effective approach allows sequencing of orthologous loci even from highly degraded DNA samples, opening new avenues of research in the field of museum genomics. Not relying on the restriction site presence, it improves among-sample loci coverage. In a trial study, hyRAD allowed us to obtain a large set of orthologous loci from fresh and museum samples from a non-model butterfly species, with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms present in all eight analyzed specimens, including 58-year-old museum samples. The utility of the method was further validated using 49 museum and fresh samples of a Palearctic grasshopper species for which the spatial genetic structure was previously assessed using mtDNA amplicons. The application of the method is eventually discussed in a wider context. As it does not rely on the restriction site presence, it is therefore not sensitive to among-sample loci polymorphisms in the restriction sites that usually causes loci dropout. This should enable the application of hyRAD to analyses at broader evolutionary scales.},

abstract = {The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 is defined here as the period either of maximum global ice volume or in which major ice sheets reached their maximum extent. Both definitions lack clarity as there is no reason to suppose that maximum volumes or limits were reached simultaneously at either all ice sheets or around the margins of individual ice sheets. Here we review the traditional terrestrial limits of the BIIS (British-Irish Ice Sheet), examine developments in understanding the offshore record, and attempt a redefinition of the extent and timing of the MIS 2 maximum. As a working chronological model the build-up of the BIIS is assigned to after 35-32 ka, the maximum to the period 27 21 ka and a more limited readvance after 19 ka. As marginal oscillations, driven by ice sheet dynamics, appear to have characterised much of the advance, and especially the retreat of the BIIS, caution should be exercised in assigning climatic significance to the many identified ice limits or still-stands. While much of the terrestrial limit in Britain remains relatively unaltered, significant revision is required offshore around Britain and Ireland, to portray an extensive ice advance to the shelf edge and a period when the BIIS was conjoined with the adjacent Fenno-Scandinavian Ice Sheet. Although there appears to be a broad synchrony between the BIIS and other major ice sheets, local controls have produced some variation in the timing of advance to and retreat from maximum limits for particular ice streams or lobes, but much of the offshore limit remains very poorly age constrained. Consequently, a key objective in future research should be to improve and refine the chronological control for all portions of the maximum margin of the BIIS and its subsequent retreat stages.

abstract = {Land is not the only barrier to dispersal encountered by marine organisms. For sedentary shallow water species, there is an additional, marine barrier, 5000 km of uninterrupted deep-water stretch between the central and the eastern Pacific. This expanse of water, known as the âEastern Pacific Barrier', has been separating faunas of the two oceanic regions since the beginning of the Cenozoic. Species with larvae that cannot stay in the plankton for the time it takes to cross between the two sides have been evolving independently. That the eastern Pacific does not share species with the rest of the Pacific was obvious to naturalists two centuries ago (Darwin 1860). Yet, this rule has exceptions. A small minority of species are known to straddle the Eastern Pacific Barrier. One such exception is the scleractinian coral Porites lobata (Fig. ). This species is spread widely throughout the Indo-Pacific, where it is one of the major reef-builders, but it is also encountered in the eastern Pacific. Are eastern and central Pacific populations of this coral connected by gene flow? In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Baums et al. (2012) use microsatellite data to answer this question. They show that P. lobata populations in the eastern Pacific are cut off from genetic influx from the rest of the Pacific. Populations within each of the two oceanic regions are genetically connected (though those in the Hawaiian islands are also isolated). Significantly, the population in the Clipperton Atoll, the westernmost island in the eastern Pacific, genetically groups with populations from the central Pacific, suggesting that crossing the Eastern Pacific Barrier by P. lobata propagules does occasionally occur.},

Some recent studies suggest that the Isthmus formed many millions of years earlier than the widely recognized age of approximately 3 million years ago (Ma), a result that if true would revolutionize our understanding of environmental, ecological, and evolutionary change across the Americas. To bring clarity to the question of when the Isthmus of Panama formed, we provide an exhaustive review and reanalysis of geological, paleontological, and molecular records. These independent lines of evidence converge upon a cohesive narrative of gradually emerging land and constricting seaways, with formation of the Isthmus of Panama sensu stricto around 2.8 Ma. The evidence used to support an older isthmus is inconclusive, and we caution against the uncritical acceptance of an isthmus before the Pliocene.},

abstract = {The importance of larval dispersal to the population dynamics and biogeography of marine organisms has been recognized for almost a century (Hjort, 1914; Thorson, 1950). More recently, theoretical studies have highlighted the role that connectivity may play in determining the resilience of marine populations (Hastings and Botsford, 2006). Effective spatial management of marine capture fisheries, including the design of marine reserve networks, also requires an understanding of population connectivity (Sale et al., 2005). However, remarkably few empirical estimates of larval dispersal or population connectivity in ocean environments exist. Direct and definitive estimates of larval dispersal in the ocean require the ability to track microscopic larvae of benthic invertebrates and fishes through the pelagic environment, from spawning locations to recruitment sites. Most marine species with pelagic larvae spawn millions of propagules that are released and then subjected to significant advection, diffusion, and mortality in vast volumes of seawater, making traditional mark-recapture approaches extremely difficult (Levin, 2006). However, ecologists have embraced recent developments in probe-based mass spectrometry to examine the chemistry of calcified structures in marine invertebrates and fishes that can be used as artificial or natural tags of natal origins. These geochemical tags are revealing fascinating data on larval dispersal that are challenging widely held paradigms concerning the spatial scale of demographic connectivity in ocean ecosystems. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The use of geochemical tags in calcified structures of fish and invertebrates is an exciting tool for investigating larval population connectivity. Tag evaluation over relatively short intervals (weeks) may detect environmental and ecological variability at a temporal scale highly relevant to larval transport and settlement. We collected newly settled mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis) weekly during winter/spring of 2002 along the coast of San Diego, CA, USA, at sites on the exposed coast (SIO) and in a protected coastal bay (HI), to investigate temporal patterns of geochemical tags in mussel shells. Analyses of post-settlement shell via LA-ICP-MS revealed statistically significant temporal variability for all elements we examined (Mg, Mn, Cu, Sr, Cd, Ba, Pb and U). Despite this, our ability to distinguish multielemental signatures between sites was largely conserved. Throughout our 13-week study, SIO and HI mussels could be chemically distinguished from one another in 78-87{\%} of all cases. Settlement varied between 2 and 27 settlers gram-byssus-1week-1 at SIO and HI, and both sites were characterized by 2-3weeks with "high" settlement. Geochemical tags recorded in early larval shell of newly settled mussels differed between "high" and "low" settlement weeks at both sites (MANOVA), driven by Mg and Sr at SIO (p=0.013) and Sr, Cd, Ba and Pb at HI (p{\textless}0.001). These data imply that shifts in larval sources or transport corridors were responsible for observed settlement variation, rather than increased larval production. In particular, increased settlement at HI was observed concurrent with the appearance of geochemical tags (e.g., elevated Cd), suggesting that those larvae were retained in upwelled water near the mouth of the bay. Such shifts may reflect short-term changes in connectivity among sites due to altered transport corridors, and influence the demography of local populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Considerable technical developments over the past half century have enabled widespread application of electronic tags to the study of animals in the wild, including in freshwater environments. We review the constraints associated with freshwater telemetry and biologging and the technical developments relevant to their use. Technical constraints for tracking animals are often influenced by the characteristics of the animals being studied and the environment they inhabit. Collectively, they influence which and how technologies can be used and their relative effectiveness. Although radio telemetry has historically been the most commonly used technology in freshwater, passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology, acoustic telemetry and biologgers are becoming more popular. Most telemetry studies have focused on fish, although an increasing number have focused on other taxa, such as turtles, crustaceans and molluscs. Key technical developments for freshwater systems include: miniaturization of tags for tracking small-size life stages and species, fixed stations and coded tags for tracking large samples of animals over long distances and large temporal scales, inexpensive PIT systems that enable mass tagging to yield population- and community-level relevant sample sizes, incorporation of sensors into electronic tags, validation of tag attachment procedures with a focus on maintaining animal welfare, incorporation of different techniques (for example, genetics, stable isotopes) and peripheral technologies (for example, geographic information systems, hydroacoustics), development of novel analytical techniques, and extensive international collaboration. Innovations are still needed in tag miniaturization, data analysis and visualization, and in tracking animals over larger spatial scales (for example, pelagic areas of lakes) and in challenging environments (for example, large dynamic floodplain systems, under ice). There seems to be a particular need for adapting various global positioning system and satellite tagging approaches to freshwater. Electronic tagging provides a mechanism to collect detailed information from imperilled animals and species that have no direct economic value. Current and future advances will continue to improve our knowledge of the natural history of aquatic animals and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems while facilitating evidence-based resource management and conservation.

abstract = {The field of marine tagging and tracking has grown rapidly in recent years as tag sizes have decreased and the diversity of sensors has increased. Tag data provide a unique view on individual movement patterns, at different scales than shipboard surveys, and have been used to discover new habitat areas, characterize oceanographic features, and delineate stock struc- tures, among other purposes. Due to the necessity for small tag-to-body size ratio, tags have largely been deployed on adult animals, resulting in a relative paucity of data on earlier life his- tory stages. In this study, we reviewed tagging efforts on multiple life history stages for seabirds, marine mammals, marine turtles, and fish and enumerated studies focusing on each guild that tar- geted larvae, juveniles or hatchlings. We found that turtles and fish had higher proportion of stud- ies focusing on juveniles ({\textgreater}20{\%}) than seabirds and marine mammals ({\textless}10{\%}). On both juveniles and adults, tags were used in a targeted manner with passive and transmitting tags as the main tools for population demography and connectivity studies, while GPS and archival tags were used more frequently for habitat analyses and foraging ecology. These findings identify the need to focus on novel approaches in tagging multiple life history stages both to study marine predator ecology and to effectively manage marine populations.},

Advances in electronic tracking technologies have been coupled with rapid development of statistical and analytical techniques. With these developments, conservation of highly migratory species has been aided by providing new information on where uncommon or endangered species go, what behaviors they perform and why, which habitats are critical, and where they range, as well as, in many cases, better estimates of their population size and the interconnectedness of subpopulations. Together these tools are providing critical insights into the ecology of highly pelagic marine vertebrates that are key for their conservation and management.},

abstract = {To estimate connectivity between populations, we used trace-element composition in otoliths of the temperate wrasse Coris julis as a proxy for the environmental conditions experienced from hatch to settlement. Recruits collected at different sites in the Azores archipelago(northeastern Atlantic) differed significantly in their natal chemical signatures, and were sufficiently diverse to be separated into in 4 distinct natal types. Types 1 and 4 were both low in Mg and Ba, although Mg was dominant in Type 1, and Type 4 was more Ba enriched. Type 2 had high Ba and intermediate Mg concentrations, while Type 3 showed the highest Mg and intermediate Ba concentrations. We identified at least 2 natal types present in recruits at each site, which suggests multiple larval sources per site. Recruits from 3 sites did not differ greatly in their natal type composition, suggesting a common set of sources, but also limiting our ability to describe meaningful connectivity and dispersal scenarios. In contrast, we found that the prevalent Natal Type 4 was absent at 1 site, suggesting that the source characterized by Natal Type 4 does not contribute to the replenishment of C. julis populations at the site. The most striking difference was observed at the smallest scale(10s of kilometers), where we found distinct natal type compositions between north and south shores on the same island, suggesting that these 2 sites have consistent differences in the contribution of specific natal sources. Further, the south shore site had recruits with elevated Mg:Ca concentrations from the otolith core to edge, which suggests that these larvae developed in inshore areas and experienced local retention. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {The dramatic progress in sequencing technologies offers unprecedented prospects for deciphering the organization of natural populations in space and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations. We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking, DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data, providing assignment of individuals to groups, a visual assessment of between-population differentiation, and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data, which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally, we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza. Analysis of simulated data revealed that our approach performs generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision. The tools implemented in DAPC for the identification of clusters and graphical representation of between-group structures allow to unravel complex population structures. Our approach is also faster than Bayesian clustering algorithms by several orders of magnitude, and may be applicable to a wider range of datasets.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged â¥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

The number of chromosomes found in spermatocytes showed a bimodal distribution in H. americanus. The chromosome number in H. gammarus spermatocytes averaged 62.5. Examination of 42 testicular cells from H. americanus yielded a diploid chromosome number of 110 with a range of 94 to 185. The diploid number in H. gammarus was determined to be 95.5 with a range of 90.5 to 134.5. The meiotic chromosome number of H. americanus was found to be bimodal at 66.5 and 68. The meiotic chromosome number in H. gammarus was 62.5. The range of meiotic chromosome counts in H. americanus was 50.5 to 83.5. In H. gammarus the range was 45 to 88. The wide range of chromosome numbers in the spermatocytes of both H. americanus and H. gammarus indicates a strong probability that supernumerary chromosomes exist in both species. Although the size and overlapping of the chromosomes made counting difficult, it is unlikely that these factors alone would result in such a wide variation in chromosome numbers$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Here, we introduce ezRAD, a novel strategy for restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) that requires little technical expertise or investment in laboratory equipment, and demonstrate its utility for ten non-model organisms across a wide taxonomic range. ezRAD differs from other RAD methods primarily through its use of standard Illumina TruSeq library preparation kits, which makes it possible for any laboratory to send out to a commercial genomic core facility for library preparation and next-generation sequencing with virtually no additional investment beyond the cost of the service itself. This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range, without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step, which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach. The simplicity of ezRAD makes it particularly useful for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted amplicon sequencing in natural populations of non-model organisms that have been historically understudied because of lack of genomic information.},

abstract = {Genotypes are frequently used to identify parentage. Such analysis is notoriously vulnerable to genotyping error, and there is ongoing debate regarding how to solve this problem. Many scientists have used the computer program CERVUS to estimate parentage, and have taken advantage of its option to allow for genotyping error. In this study, we show that the likelihood equations used by versions 1.0 and 2.0 of CERVUS to accommodate genotyping error miscalculate the probability of observing an erroneous genotype. Computer simulation and reanalysis of paternity in Rum red deer show that correcting this error increases success in paternity assignment, and that there is a clear benefit to accommodating genotyping errors when errors are present. A new version of CERVUS (3.0) implementing the corrected likelihood equations is available at http://www.fieldgenetics.com.},

abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized many areas of biology, but sequencing large amounts of DNA in many individuals is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary for many studies. Genomic complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction enzyme-based methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per unit cost. Despite their utility, current complexity reduction methods have limitations, especially when large numbers of individuals are analyzed. Here we develop a much improved restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol and a new method called Rapture ( R: AD c APTURE: ). The new RAD protocol improves versatility by separating RAD tag isolation and sequencing library preparation into two distinct steps. This protocol also recovers more unique (nonclonal) RAD fragments, which improves both standard RAD and Rapture analysis. Rapture then uses an in-solution capture of chosen RAD tags to target sequencing reads to desired loci. Rapture combines the benefits of both RAD and sequence capture, i.e., very inexpensive and rapid library preparation for many individuals as well as high specificity in the number and location of genomic loci analyzed. Our results demonstrate that Rapture is a rapid and flexible technology capable of analyzing a very large number of individuals with minimal sequencing and library preparation cost. The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and biomedical science.},

abstract = {Natural populations worldwide are increasingly fragmented by habitat loss. Isolation at small population size is thought to reduce individual and population fitness via inbreeding depression. However, little is known about the time-scale over which adverse genetic effects may develop in natural populations or the number and types of traits likely to be affected. The benefits of restoring gene flow to isolates are therefore also largely unknown. In contrast, the potential costs of migration (e.g. disease spread) are readily apparent. Management for ecological connectivity has therefore been controversial and sometimes avoided. Using pedigree and life-history data collected during 25 years of study, we evaluated genetic decline and rescue in a population of bighorn sheep founded by 12 individuals in 1922 and isolated at an average size of 42 animals for 10-12 generations. Immigration was restored experimentally, beginning in 1985. We detected marked improvements in reproduction, survival and five fitness-related traits among descendants of the 15 recent migrants. Trait values were increased by 23-257{\%} in maximally outbred individuals. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of increased male and female fitness attributable to outbreeding realized in a fully competitive natural setting. Our findings suggest that genetic principles deserve broader recognition as practical management tools with near-term consequences for large-mammal conservation.},

Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

However, methods currently used for aquatic species are costly, time intensive, biased and often require destructive or injurious sampling. Hence, developing a non-invasive sampling method to accurately determine the timing and location of reproduction for aquatic species would be extremely valuable. 2.We conducted an experimental and field study to determine the influence of spawning, and the mass release of spermatozoa in particular, on environmental DNA (eDNA) concentrations. Using a quantitative PCR approach we monitored changes in nuclear and mitochondrial eDNA concentrations over time. 3.The data from the experimental study and the field survey supported our hypothesis that spawning events are characterized by higher concentrations of nuclear relative to mitochondrial eDNA. Outside of the reproductive period, we find that nuclear and mitochondrial DNA fragments are equally abundant in environmental water samples. 4.We have shown that changes in the relative abundance of nuclear and mitochondrial eDNA can be used to monitor spawning activity of the endangered Macquarie perch. Our method is likely to be transferrable to other aquatic species and can be particularly useful to increase our understanding of the spawning biology of cryptic, rare or threatened species as well as design and evaluate environmental management actions and determine species establishment.},

abstract = {Marine species live in a wide diversity of environments and yet, because of their pelagic life stages, are thought to be well-connected: they have high migration rates that inhibit significant population structure. Recent innovations in sequencing technologies now provide information on nucleotide polymorphisms at thousands to tens of thousands of loci based on whole genomes, reduced representative portions of genomes (0.1-1{\%}) or a majority of expressed mRNAs. Data from these genomic approaches are used to define and quantify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNP data tend to agree with data from older technologies (allozymes or microsatellites), which support well-connected populations with few genetic differences among populations. However, these studies also find few percentages of SNPs (1-5{\%}) that readily distinguish genetic differences among populations on relatively small geographic scales. The magnitudes of the genetic differences (FSTvalues) suggest that hundreds of loci with significant differences are due to positive selective pressures. Thus, these data suggest that natural selection is effectively altering allele frequencies at 100s of loci in marine populations. In this manuscript, we provide examples of these studies, the strengths and weaknesses of different genomic approaches as well as important technical aspects associated with genomic approaches.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement and decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the field of genomics and beyond. NGS has led to astonishing number of scientific advances and has offered a paradigm shift from gene to genome-wide research in the field of fisheries and aquaculture. Researchers in fish biology have used NGS to discover novel genetic markers for population and traceability studies. Additionally, NGS technologies have been utilized for ecotoxicological applications, genome-wide characterization to find the genomic regions associated with commercially important traits, profiling of messenger-RNAs and micro-RNAs to study the control of biological processes, and to learn more about evolutionary questions. In recent years, great efforts have been made on sequencing the genomes of economically important aquaculture species. These efforts have shown astounding potential to bring enormous change in genetic and biological research in fisheries and aquaculture. Nevertheless, genomic information for most of the fish species is still lacking and results of some studies using NGS were presented without keeping proper sampling and/or experimental design. Future studies should be spread on other non-model species, but with proper sampling respecting aim of such studies. Only then, it is possible to understand well genetic and biological significance of investigated species for fisheries and aquaculture. This review summarizes various applications of next-generation sequencing that has been used in fishery research up to now.},

abstract = {The phylum Cnidaria is usually divided into five classes: Anthozoa, Cubozoa, Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa and Staurozoa. The class Anthozoa is subdivided into two subclasses: Hexacoral- lia and Octocorallia. Morphological and molecular studies based on nuclear rDNA and recent phylogenomic studies support the monophyly of Anthozoa. On the other hand, molecular studies based on mitochondrial markers, including two recent studies based on mitogenomic data, supported the paraphyly of Anthozoa, and positioned Octocorallia as sis- ter group to Medusozoa (the monophyletic group of Cubozoa, Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa). On the basis of 51 nuclear orthologs from four hexacorallians, four octocorallians, two hydrozoans and one scyphozoan (with poriferans and Homo sapiens as out-groups), we built a multilocus alignment of 9 873 amino acids, which aimed at minimizing missing data and hidden paralogy, in order to understand the discrepancy between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies. Our phylogenetic analyses strongly supported the monophyly of Anthozoa. We compared the level of substitution saturation between our data set, the data sets of two recent phylogenomic studies and one of a mitogenomic study. We found that mitochondrial DNA is more saturated than nuclear DNA at all the phylogenetic levels studied. Our results emphasize the need for a good evaluation of phylogenetic signal.},

abstract = {Understanding how and why populations evolve is of fundamental importance to molecular ecology. RADseq (Restriction site-Associated DNA sequencing), a popular reduced representation method, has ushered in a new era of genome-scale research for assessing population structure, hybridization, demographic history, phylogeography, and migration. RADseq has also been widely used to conduct genome scans to detect loci involved in adaptive divergence among natural populations. Here, we examine the capacity of those RADseq-based genome scan studies to detect loci involved in local adaptation. To understand what proportion of the genome is missed by RADseq studies, we developed a simple model using different numbers of RAD-tags, genome sizes, and extents of linkage disequilibrium (length of haplotype blocks). We then surveyed recent studies that have used RADseq for genome scans and found that that the median density of RADseq markers across these studies was one marker per 3.96 megabases. Given that the length of linkage disequilibrium is often orders of magnitude less than a megabase, we conclude that genome scans based on RADseq data alone are unlikely to advance our understanding of molecular ecology or evolutionary genetics for most systems.

In contrast to previous recommendations, we propose that the use of neutral versus adaptive markers should not be viewed as alternatives. Rather, neutral and adaptive markers provide different types of information that should be combined to make optimal management decisions. Genetic patterns at neutral markers reflect the interaction of gene flow and genetic drift that affects genome-wide variation within and among populations. This population genetic structure is what natural selection operates on to cause adaptive divergence. Here, we provide a new framework to integrate data on neutral and adaptive markers to protect biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In response, international regulations have been imposed and many fisheries have been 'eco-certified' by consumer organizations, but methods for independent control of catch certificates and eco-labels are urgently needed. Here we show that, by using gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, individual marine fish can be assigned back to population of origin with unprecedented high levels of precision. By applying high differentiation single nucleotide polymorphism assays, in four commercial marine fish, on a pan-European scale, we find 93-100{\%} of individuals could be correctly assigned to origin in policy-driven case studies. We show how case-targeted single nucleotide polymorphism assays can be created and forensically validated, using a centrally maintained and publicly available database. Our results demonstrate how application of gene-associated markers will likely revolutionize origin assignment and become highly valuable tools for fighting illegal fishing and mislabelling worldwide.},

More importantly, it has changed the way we design and describe Marine Protected Areas across the world. Population genetics is the preferred tool when measuring connectivity patterns, however, these methods often assume that dispersal patterns are (1) natural and (2) follow traditional metapopulation models. In this short review, we formally introduce the phenomenon of cryptic dispersal, where multiple introductory events can undermine these assumptions, resulting in grossly inaccurate connectivity estimates. We also discuss the evolutionary consequences of cryptic dispersal and advocate for a cross-disciplinary approach that incorporates larval transport models into population genetic studies to provide a level of oceanographic realism that will result in more accurate estimates of dispersal. As globalized trade continues to expand, the rate of anthropogenic movement of marine organisms is also expected to increase and as such, integrated methods will be required to meet the inevitable conservation challenges that will arise from it.},

In order to identify a cost-effective subset of SNPs, they were ranked according to their ability to differentiate between fish from different rivers. A panel of 288 SNPs was used to examine both individual assignments and mixed stock fisheries and eighteen assignment units were defined. The results improved greatly on previously available methods and, for the first time, fish caught in the marine environment can be confidently assigned to geo-graphically coherent units within Scotland and NE England, including individual rivers. As such, this SNP panel has the potential to aid understanding of the various influences acting upon Atlantic salmon on their marine migrations, be they natural environmental variations and/or anthropogenic impacts, such as mixed stock fisheries and interactions with marine power generation installations.},

Identification of genetic stocks and assessment of divergence among them, is critical in order to implement management strategies. Population genetic structure in the Mediterranean basin is not clear and has not been extensively investigated with highly informative markers for population analyses. In this work, we aimed to identify a small SNP panel to be utilized for fine scale population genetic analysis within the Mediterranean basin. In order to do that, we used a set of 424 species-specific SNPs for assessing differentiation among E. encrasicolus populations within the Mediterranean and between Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Hence, we applied a Fst ranking method, for selecting a SNP sub-set from the large 424 SNPs panel and we compared the results obtained with the two sets of markers. Population assignment power and patterns of population differentiation were comparable. Analyses revealed a clear distinction between anchovies in the Atlantic and Mediterranean areas, and lower differentiation among Mediterranean populations. Our approach was successful in selecting a 96 SNP subset with high resolution and cost effectiveness to genotyping that can represent a useful tool for population genetic studies and stock management in this economically important species.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are valuable tools for ecological and evolutionary studies. In non-model species, the use of SNPs has been limited by the number of markers available. However, new technologies and decreasing technology costs have facilitated the discovery of a constantly increasing number of SNPs. With hundreds or thousands of SNPs potentially available, there is interest in comparing and developing methods for evaluating SNPs to create panels of high-throughput assays that are customized for performance, research questions, and resources. Here we use five different methods to rank 43 new SNPs and 71 previously published SNPs for sockeye salmon: FST, informativeness (In), average contribution to principal components (LC), and the locus-ranking programs BELS and WHICHLOCI. We then tested the performance of these different ranking methods by creating 48- and 96-SNP panels of the top-ranked loci for each method and used empirical and simulated data to obtain the probability of assigning individuals to the correct population using each panel. All 96-SNP panels performed similarly and better than the 48-SNP panels except for the 96-SNP BELS panel. Among the 48-SNP panels, panels created from FST, In, and LC ranks performed better than panels formed using the top-ranked loci from the programs BELS and WHICHLOCI. The application of ranking methods to optimize panel performance will become more important as more high-throughput assays become available.},

Genomic approaches bring a new paradigm for fisheries management by making it possible to integrate adaptive diversity to understand fundamental aspects of fisheries resources. Hence, this review is focused on the relevance of genomic approaches to solve fisheries-specific questions. Particularly the detection of adaptive diversity (outlier loci) provides unprecedented opportunity to understand bio-complexity, increased power to trace processed sample origin to allow enforcement and the potential to understand the genetic basis of micro-evolutionary effects of fisheries-induced evolution and climate change. The understanding of adaptive diversity patterns will be the cornerstone of the future links between fisheries and genomics. These studies will help stakeholders anticipate the potential effects of fishing or climate change on the resilience of fisheries stocks; consequently, in the near future, fisheries sciences might integrate evolutionary principles with fisheries management.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the major known monospecific and multispecific sponge aggregations in the world's oceans. They are shown to occur from the intertidal to abyssal depths, in tropical, temperate, and high latitudes and sometimes to create spectacular formations, such as glass sponge reefs, lithistid reef-like fields, and carnivorous sponge grounds. Sponge aggregations are recognized as singular vulnerable habitats that deserve special research attention and legal protection. However, this review reveals that there is only a poor and fragmentary under- standing of the main biological, environmental, and geochemical factors that favor and maintain these systems, including the food supply, which is funda- mental knowledge. There is also a particular lack of information regarding reproductive biology, growth rates, life spans, and the main factors causing mortality, all crucial drivers for understanding population and community dynamics and for developing conservation strategies. The sponge aggregations have been shown to increase the structural complexity of the habitats, attracting a larger variety of organisms and locally enhancing biodiversity. From the very few cases in which sponge biomass and sponge physiology have been reliably approached jointly, phenomenal fluxes of matter and energy have been inferred. Through their benthic-pelagic coupling, some of the densest sponge aggrega- tions have a significant local or regional impact on major biogeochemical cycles and food webs. Physical damage and habitat destruction derived from man-driven activities along with epidemic diseases facilitated by global envi- ronmental alterations emerge as major threats to the future of the sponge aggregations.},

abstract = {As highlighted by many of the papers in this issue, research on the genomic basis of adaptive phenotypic variation in natural populations has made spectacular progress in the past few years, largely due to the advances in sequencing technology and analysis. Without question, the resulting genomic data will improve the understanding of regions of the genome under selection and extend knowledge of the genetic basis of adaptive evolution. What is far less clear, but has been the focus of active discussion, is how such information can or should transfer into conservation practice to complement more typical conservation applications of genetic data. Before such applications can be realized, the evolutionary importance of specific targets of selection relative to the genome-wide diversity of the species as a whole must be evaluated. The key issues for the incorporation of adaptive genomic variation in conservation and management are discussed here, using published examples of adaptive genomic variation associated with specific phenotypes in salmonids and other taxa to highlight practical considerations for incorporating such information into conservation programmes. Scenarios are described in which adaptive genomic data could be used in conservation or restoration, constraints on its utility and the importance of validating inferences drawn from new genomic data before applying them in conservation practice. Finally, it is argued that an excessive focus on preserving the adaptive variation that can be measured, while ignoring the vast unknown majority that cannot, is a modern twist on the adaptationist programme that Gould and Lewontin critiqued almost 40 years ago. },

abstract = {Reduced representation genome-sequencing approaches based on restriction digestion are enabling large-scale marker generation and facilitating genomic studies in a wide range of model and nonmodel systems. However, sampling chromosomes based on restriction digestion may introduce a bias in allele frequency estimation due to polymorphisms in restriction sites. To explore the effects of this nonrandom sampling and its sensitivity to different evolutionary parameters, we developed a coalescent-simulation framework to mimic the biased recovery of chromosomes in restriction-based short-read sequencing experiments (RADseq). We analysed simulated DNA sequence datasets and compared known values from simulations with those that would be estimated using a RADseq approach from the same samples. We compare these 'true' and 'estimated' values of commonly used summary statistics, $\pi$, $\theta$(w), Tajima's D and F(ST). We show that loci with missing haplotypes have estimated summary statistic values that can deviate dramatically from true values and are also enriched for particular genealogical histories. These biases are sensitive to nonequilibrium demography, such as bottlenecks and population expansion. In silico digests with 102 completely sequenced Drosophila melanogaster genomes yielded results similar to our findings from coalescent simulations. Though the potential of RADseq for marker discovery and trait mapping in nonmodel systems remains undisputed, our results urge caution when applying this technique to make population genetic inferences.},

abstract = {The conservation of threatened species must be underpinned by phylogeographic knowledge in order to be effective. This need is epitomised by the freshwater fish Carassius carassius, which has recently undergone drastic declines across much of its European range. Restriction Site Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) is being increasingly used for such phylogeographic questions, however RADseq is expensive, and limitations on sample number must be weighed against the benefit of large numbers of markers. Such tradeoffs have predominantly been addressed using simulated data. Here we compare the results generated from microsatellites and RADseq to the phylogeography of C. carassius, to add real-data-informed perspectives to this important debate. These datasets, along with data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, agree on broad phylogeographic patterns; showing the existence of two previously unidentified C. carassius lineages in Europe. These lineages have been isolated for approximately 2.2-2.3 M years, and should arguably be considered as separate conservation units. RADseq recovered finer population structure and stronger patterns of IBD than microsatellites, despite including only 17.6{\%} of samples (38{\%} of populations and 52{\%} of samples per population). RADseq was also used along with Approximate Bayesian Computation to show that the postglacial colonisation routes of C. carassius differ from the general patterns of freshwater fish in Europe, likely as a result of their distinctive ecology.},

abstract = {The remarkable increase of Homarus Americanus (lobster) abundance in recent years has resulted in record landings throughout the states and provinces along the perimeter of the Gulf of Maine. A considerable amount of data on various life stages of lobsters has been collected for research, management and conservation purposes over the past 15 years. We have used these data sets to develop models that simulate lobster populations from newly hatched larval stage through settlement and recruitment to the fishery. This paper presents a part of the synthesis study that focuses on the early life history of lobsters. A coupled biophysical individual based model was developed that considers patterns of egg production (abundance, distribution and timing of hatch), temperature-dependent larval growth, stage-explicit vertical distributions of larvae, and mortality. The biophysical model was embedded in the realistic simulations of the physical environment (current and temperature) from the Gulf of Maine Nowcast/Forecast System. The predominant direction of larval movement follows the cyclonic Gulf of Maine Coastal Current (GMCC). Results show relatively low accumulation of planktonic stages along the eastern Maine coast and high accumulation along the western Maine coast. In years when the eastern branch of the GMCC turns offshore southeast of Penobscot Bay, more particles accumulate downstream of the branch point. Interannual variability is also apparent in development times that vary as a function of year-to-year water temperature variation. The larval stages tend to remain relatively near shore, but the final planktonic stage (the postlarva) resides near the sea surface, and the prevailing southwesterly winds in summer cause eastward and offshore drift of postlarvae. Thus, more settlement might take place earlier in the potentially long postlarval stage, and the timing and strength of the southwesterly winds are important in determining the population of potential settlers. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The king scallop (Pecten maximus) is one of the most important benthic species of the English Channel as it constitutes the first fishery in terms of landings in this area. To support strategies of spatial fishery management, we develop a high-resolution biophysical model to study scallop dispersal in two bays along the French coasts of the English Channel (i.e. the bay of Saint-Brieuc and the bay of Seine) and to quantify the relative roles of local hydrodynamic processes, temperature-dependent planktonic larval duration (PLD) and active swimming behaviour (SB). The two bays are chosen for three reasons: (1) the distribution of the scallop stocks in these areas is well known from annual scallop stock surveys, (2) these two bays harbour important fisheries and (3) scallops in these two areas present some differences in terms of reproductive cycle and spawning duration. The English Channel currents and temperature are simulated for 10 years (2000-2010) with the MARS-3D code and then used by the Lagrangian module of MARS-3D to model the transport. Results were analysed in terms of larval distribution at settlement and connectivity rates. While larval transport in the two bays depended both on the tidal residual circulation and the wind-induced currents, the relative role of these two hydrodynamic processes varied among bays. In the bay of Saint-Brieuc, the main patterns of larval dispersal were due to tides, the wind being only a source of variability in the extent of larval patch and the local retention rate. Conversely, in the bay of Seine, wind-induced currents altered both the direction and the extent of larval transport. The main effect of a variable PLD in relation to the thermal history of each larva was to reduce the spread of dispersal and consequently increase the local retention by about 10 {\%} on average. Although swimming behaviour could influence larval dispersal during the first days of the PLD when larvae are mainly located in surface waters, it has a minor role on larval distribution at settlement and retention rates. The analysis of the connectivity between subpopulations within each bay allows identifying the main sources of larvae which depend on both the characteristics of local hydrodynamics and the spatial heterogeneity in the reproductive outputs.},

We performed the coupling sequentially, which underlined the respective role of biological and physical factors in defining P. maximus distribution in the English Channel. Results show that larval dispersion by hydrodynamics explains most of the scallop distribution and enlighten the main known hotspots for the population, basically corresponding to the main fishing areas. The mechanistic description of individual bioenergetics shows that food availability and temperature control growth and reproduction and explain how populations may maintain themselves in particular locations. This last coupling leads to more realistic densities and distributions of adults in the English Channel. The results of this study improves our knowledge on the stock and distribution dynamics of P. maximus, and provides grounds for useful tools to support management strategies.},

abstract = {We used a coupled biophysical model to investigate larval transport and connectivity patterns in the Gulf of Maine lobster (Homarus americanus) population. Biological 'particles' were released at over 21 000 locations every 10 days over a 4-month hatching period, and were followed from hatching through late postlarval stage. In addition to circulation and dispersion, model calculations included spatial patterns of egg production, temporal patterns of hatching, temperature-dependent development, vertical distribution and mortality. We ran the model for three larval production seasons using the same hatching patterns and individual-based modeling parameters but different flow patterns in the coastal current system. Model results gave distribution and abundance patterns of competent postlarvae that closely resembled observed, alongshore patterns of lobster settlement density. We evaluated the relative contribution of all source regions to the total number of competent postlarvae in a series of medium-size zones along the coastal shelf, many of which are used in lobster management. Connectivity depended on many factors, including patterns of egg production and transport, and the location and size of the receiving zones. Self recruitment ranged from a few percent to {\textgreater} 90{\%} of competent postlarvae. Although it was common for postlarvae to come from many, often distant, sources, most of the competent postlarvae in a zone originated within one to two zones in the prevailing 'up-stream' direction, forming shorter connections along the coast than the energetic currents might otherwise suggest. Inshore migrations during summer hatching may contribute to these shorter patterns of connectivity. Transport in the prevailing 'upstream' direction was also indicated.},

This guidance was based on Government policy principles, including that MCZs should be designated based on ???best available evidence???. This paper analyses the multi-dimensional conflicts that emerged within the stakeholder group in south-west England, which were magnified by uncertainty about future MCZ management. In September 2011, after working through these conflicts through trade-offs and negotiations, the stakeholder groups jointly recommended 127 MCZs to Government. The process subsequently shifted to a top-down approach, with further stakeholder engagement limited to bilateral consultation. There was a concurrent shift in policy, from a broad-scale network-level focus towards single-feature conservation. A lengthy series of evidence reviews concluded that the existing evidence at the time was insufficient to progress with the designation of most sites, marking a clear departure from the policy principle of proceeding with the designation of a representative network based on ???best available evidence???, and effectively undermining the work carried out by stakeholder groups. Though MCZ designation was originally timetabled for 2012, in November 2013 just 27 of the recommended 127 MCZs were designated in a first tranche. At the time, no clear timetable was in place for subsequent tranches.},

abstract = {For over half a century, it has been known that the rate of morphological evolution appears to vary with the time frame of measurement. Rates of microevolutionary change, measured between successive generations, were found to be far higher than rates of macroevolutionary change inferred from the fossil record. More recently, it has been suggested that rates of molecular evolution are also time dependent, with the estimated rate depending on the timescale of measurement. This followed surprising observations that estimates of mutation rates, obtained in studies of pedigrees and laboratory mutation-accumulation lines, exceeded long-term substitution rates by an order of magnitude or more. Although a range of studies have provided evidence for such a pattern, the hypothesis remains relatively contentious. Furthermore, there is ongoing discussion about the factors that can cause molecular rate estimates to be dependent on time. Here we present an overview of our current understanding of time-dependent rates. We provide a summary of the evidence for time-dependent rates in animals, bacteria and viruses. We review the various biological and methodological factors that can cause rates to be time dependent, including the effects of natural selection, calibration errors, model misspecification and other artefacts. We also describe the challenges in calibrating estimates of molecular rates, particularly on the intermediate timescales that are critical for an accurate characterization of time-dependent rates. This has important consequences for the use of molecular-clock methods to estimate timescales of recent evolutionary events.},

abstract = {We present moments and likelihood methods that estimate a DNA substitution rate from a group of closely related sister species pairs separated at an assumed time, and we test these methods with simulations. The methods also estimate ancestral population size and can test whether there is a significant difference among the ancestral population sizes of the sister species pairs. Estimates presented in the literature often ignore the ancestral coalescent prior to speciation and therefore should be biased upward. The simulations show that both methods yield accurate estimates given sample sizes of five or more species pairs and that better likelihood estimates are obtained if there is no significant difference among ancestral population sizes. The model presented here indicates that the larger than expected variation found in multitaxa datasets can be explained by variation in the ancestral coalescence and the Poisson mutation process. In this context, observed variation can often be accounted for by variation in ancestral population sizes rather than invoking variation in other parameters, such as divergence time or mutation rate. The methods are applied to data from two groups of species pairs (sea urchins and Alpheus snapping shrimp) that are thought to have separated by the rise of Panama three million years ago.},

@article{Hofreiter2009,
abstract = {Apart from the current human-induced climate change, the??Holocene is notable for its stable climate. In contrast, the preceding age, the Pleistocene, was a time of intensive climatic fluctuations, with temperature changes of up to 15??C occurring within a few decades. These climatic changes have substantially influenced both animal and plant populations. Until recently, the prevailing opinion about the effect of these climatic fluctuations on species in Europe was that populations survived glacial maxima in southern refugia and that populations died out outside these refugia. However, some of the latest studies of modern population genetics, the fossil record and especially ancient DNA reveal a more complex picture. There is now strong evidence for additional local northern refugia for a large number of species, including both plants and animals. Furthermore, population genetic analyses using ancient DNA have shown that genetic diversity and its geographical structure changed more often and in more unpredictable ways during the Pleistocene than had been inferred. Taken together, the Pleistocene is now seen as an extremely dynamic era, with rapid and large climatic fluctuations and correspondingly variable ecology. These changes were accompanied by similarly fast and sometimes dramatic changes in population size and extensive gene flow mediated by population movements. Thus, the Pleistocene is an excellent model case for the effects of rapid climate change, as we experience at the moment, on the ecology of plants and animals. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The glacial episodes of the Quaternary (2.6 million years ago-present) were a major factor in shaping the present-day distributions of extant flora and fauna, with expansions and contractions of the ice sheets rendering large areas uninhabitable for most species. Fossil records suggest that many species survived glacial maxima by retreating to refugia, usually at lower latitudes. Recently, phylogeographic studies have given support to the existence of previously unknown, or cryptic, refugia. Here we summarise many of these insights into the glacial histories of species in cryptic refugia gained through phylogeographic approaches. Understanding such refugia might be important as the Earth heads into another period of climate change, in terms of predicting the effects on species distribution and survival. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Combining phylogeographic data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Nearctic and Palearctic freshwater and anadromous fishes, we used a comparative approach to assess the influence of historical events on evolutionary patterns and processes in regional fish faunas. Specifically, we (i) determined whether regional faunas differentially affected by Pleistocene glaciations show predictable differences in phylogeographic patterns; (ii) evalu- ated how processes of divergence and speciation have been influenced by such differential responses; and (iii) assessed the general contribution of phylogeographic studies to conser- vation issues. Comparisons among case studies revealed fundamental differences in phylo- geographic patterns among regional faunas. Tree topologies were typically deeper for species from nonglaciated regions compared to northern species, whereas species with partially glaciated ranges were intermediate in their characteristics. Phylogeographic patterns were strikingly similar among southern species, whereas species in glaciated areas showed reduced concordance. The extent and locations of secondary contact among mtDNA lineages varied greatly among northern species, resulting in reduced intraspecific concor- dance of genetic markers for some northern species. Regression analysis of phylogeographic data for 42 species revealed significant latitudinal shifts in intraspecific genetic diversity. Both relative nucleotide diversity and estimates of evolutionary effective population size showed significant breakpoints matching the median latitude for the southern limit of the Pleistocene glaciations. Similarly, analysis of clade depth of phylogenetically distinct lineages vs. area occupied showed that evolutionary dispersal rates of species from glaciated and nonglaciated regions differed by two orders of magnitude. A negative relationship was also found between sequence divergence among sister species as a function of their median distributional latitude, indicating that recent bursts of speciation events have occurred in deglaciated habitats. Phylogeographic evidence for parallel evolution of sympatric northern species pairs in postglacial times suggested that differentiation of cospecific morphotypes may be driven by ecological release. Altogether, these results demonstrate that comparative phylogeography can be used to evaluate not only phylogeographic patterns but also evolu- tionary processes. As well as having significant implications for conservation programs, this approach enables new avenues of research for examining the regional, historical, and eco- logical factors involved in shaping intraspecific genetic diversity.},

Observations of this variability provide constraints on the timing, rates, and magnitudes of the changes in ice mass during a glacial cycle, as well as more limited information on the distribution of ice between the major ice sheets at any time. Observations of glacially induced sea level changes also provide information on the response of the mantle to surface loading on time scales of 10(3) to 10(5) years. Regional analyses indicate that the earth-response function is depth dependent as well as spatially variable. Comprehensive models of sea level change enable the migration of coastlines to be predicted during glacial cycles, including the anthropologically important period from about 60,000 to 20,000 years ago.},

abstract = {Efforts to extract a Greenland ice core with a complete record of the Eemian interglacial (130,000 to 115,000 years ago) have until now been unsuccessful. The response of the Greenland ice sheet to the warmer-than-present climate of the Eemian has thus remained unclear. Here we present the new North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (âNEEM') ice core and show only a modest ice-sheet response to the strong warming in the early Eemian. We reconstructed the Eemian record from folded ice using globally homogeneous parameters known from dated Greenland and Antarctic ice-core records. On the basis of water stable isotopes, NEEM surface temperatures after the onset of the Eemian (126,000 years ago) peaked at 8 Â± 4 degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium, followed by a gradual cooling that was probably driven by the decreasing summer insolation. Between 128,000 and 122,000 years ago, the thickness of the northwest Greenland ice sheet decreased by 400 Â± 250 metres, reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of 130 Â± 300 metres lower than the present. Extensive surface melt occurred at the NEEM site during the Eemian, a phenomenon witnessed when melt layers formed again at NEEM during the exceptional heat of July 2012. With additional warming, surface melt might become more common in the future.},

We provide an internally consistent database of coral U-Th ages to assess last interglacial sea-level observations in the context of isostatic modeling and stratigraphic evidence. These data indicate that global (eustatic) sea level peaked 5.5 to 9 meters above present sea level, requiring smaller ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica relative to today and indicating strong sea-level sensitivity to small changes in radiative forcing.},

Since the latest of these oscillations, the Last Glacial Maximum (between about 30,000 and 19,000 years ago), approximately 50 million cubic kilometres of ice has melted from the land-based ice sheets, raising global sea level by approximately 130 metres. Such rapid changes in sea level are part of a complex pattern of interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, ice sheets and solid earth, all of which have different response timescales. The trigger for the sea-level fluctuations most probably lies with changes in insolation, caused by astronomical forcing, but internal feedback cycles complicate the simple model of causes and effects.},

abstract = {Glacial cycles have played a dominant role in shaping the genetic structure and distribution of biota in northwestern North America. The two major ice age refugia of Beringia and the Pacific Northwest were connected by major mountain chains and bordered by the Pacific Ocean. As a result, numerous refugial options were available for the regions taxa during glacial advances. We reviewed the importance of glaciations and refugia in shaping northwestern North America's phylogeographic history. We also tested whether ecological variables were associated with refugial history. The recurrent phylogeographic patterns that emerged were the following: (i) additional complexity, i.e. refugia within refugia, in both Beringia and the Pacific Northwest; and (ii) strong evidence for cryptic refugia in the Alexander Archipelago and Haida Gwaii, the Canadian Arctic and within the ice-sheets. Species with contemporary ranges that covered multiple refugia, or those with high dispersal ability, were significantly more likely to have resided in multiple refugia. Most of the shared phylogeographic patterns can be attributed to multiple refugial locales during the last glacial maximum or major physiographic barriers like rivers and glaciers. However, some of the observed patterns are much older and appear connected to the orogeny of the Cascade-Sierra chain or allopatric differentiation during historic glacial advances. The emergent patterns from this review suggest we should refine the classic Beringian-southern refugial paradigm for northwestern North American biota and highlight the ecological and evolutionary consequences of colonization from multiple refugia.},

abstract = {Aim To develop and test theory based on connectivity to identify optimal networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) that protect multiple species with a range of dispersal strategies. Location The eastern North Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. Methods Theory of finding optimal MPA network is based on eigenvalue perturbation theory applied to population connectivity. Previous theory is here extended to the persistence of multiple species by solving a maximization problem with constraints, which identifies an optimal consensus network of MPAs. The theory is applied to two test cases within a 120,000 km2 area in the North Sea where connectivity was estimated with a biophysical model. In a realistic case, the theory is applied to the protection of rocky-reef habitats, where the biophysical model is parameterized with realistic dispersal traits for key species. Theoretical predictions of optimal networks were validated with a simple metapopulation model. Persistence of optimal consensus MPA networks is compared to randomly selected networks as well as to the existing MPA network. Results Despite few overlapping MPA sites for the optimal networks based on single dispersal strategies, the consensus network for multiple dispersal strategies performed well for 3 of 4 contrasting strategies even without user-defined constraints. In the test with five realistic dispersal strategies, representing a community on threatened rocky reefs, the consensus network performed equally well compared to solutions for single species. Different dispersal strategies were also protected jointly across the MPA network (93{\%} of sites), in contrast to simulations of the existing MPA network (2{\%} of sites). Consensus networks based on connectivity were significantly more efficient compared to existing MPAs. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the new theoretic framework can identify a consensus MPA network that protects a whole community containing species with multiple dispersal strategies.},

We review the major questions and controversies that have preoccupied population geneticists during this time (and were often hotly debated at PGG meetings). We show how theoretical and empirical work has combined to generate a highly productive interaction involving successive developments in the ability to characterise variability at the molecular level, to apply mathematical models to the interpretation of the data and to use the results to answer biologically important questions, even in nonmodel organisms. We also describe the changes from a field that was largely dominated by UK and North American biologists to a much more international one (with the PGG meetings having made important contributions to the increased number of population geneticists in several European countries). Although we concentrate on the earlier history of the field, because developments in recent years are more familiar to most contemporary researchers, we end with a brief outline of topics in which new understanding is still actively developing.Heredity advance online publication, 27 July 2016; doi:10.1038/hdy.2016.55.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly implemented as tools to conserve and manage fisheries and target species. Because there are opportunity costs to conservation, there is a need for science-based assessment of MPAs. Here, we present one of the northernmost documentations of MPA effects to date, demonstrated by a replicated before-after control-impact (BACI) approach. In 2006, MPAs were implemented along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast offering complete protection to shellfish and partial protection to fish. By 2010, European lobster (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) had increased by 245 per cent in MPAs, whereas CPUE in control areas had increased by 87 per cent. Mean size of lobsters increased by 13 per cent in MPAs, whereas increase in control areas was negligible. Furthermore, MPA-responses and population development in control areas varied significantly among regions. This illustrates the importance of a replicated BACI design for reaching robust conclusions and management decisions. Partial protection of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was followed by an increase in population density and body size compared with control areas. By 2010, MPA cod were on average 5 cm longer than in any of the control areas. MPAs can be useful management tools in rebuilding and conserving portions of depleted lobster populations in northern temperate waters, and even for a mobile temperate fish species such as the Atlantic cod.},

As the discipline grows, however, misconceptions have become enshrined in the literature and are perpetuated by routine citations to other articles in molecular ecology. These misconceptions hamper a better understanding of the processes that influence genetic variation in natural populations and sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions. Here, we consider eight misconceptions commonly appearing in the literature: (i) some molecular markers are inherently better than other markers; (ii) mtDNA produces higher F(ST) values than nDNA; (iii) estimated population coalescences are real; (iv) more data are always better; (v) one needs to do a Bayesian analysis; (vi) selective sweeps influence mtDNA data; (vii) equilibrium conditions are critical for estimating population parameters; and (viii) having better technology makes us smarter than our predecessors. This is clearly not an exhaustive list and many others can be added. It is, however, sufficient to illustrate why we all need to be more critical of our own understanding of molecular ecology and to be suspicious of self-evident truths.},

These objectives reflect political and societal views, and increasingly reconcile fishery and conservation concerns, a consequence of common high-level drivers, such as the World Summit on Sustainable Development. The contribution of MPAs to meeting objectives should be assessed in conjunction with other tools, taking account of the management systems of which they are part. Many of the same factors determine the success of MPAs and other management tools, such as quality of governance and the social and economic situation of people using marine goods and services. Diverse legislation governs MPA designation. Designation could be simplified by prearranged and prenegotiated agreements among all relevant authorities. Agreements could specify how to make trade-offs among objectives, interpret scientific advice, ensure effective engagement among authorities and stakeholders, deal with appeals, and support progressive improvement. The jurisdiction and competence of fishery management authorities mean that they are well placed to contribute to the design, designation, and enforcement of MPAs. Their strengths include well-established procedures for accessing scientific advice, the capacity to work across multiple jurisdictions, experience with MPA management, and access to vessels and personnel for enforcement.},

abstract = {Population genomic approaches are making rapid inroads in the study of non-model organisms, including marine taxa. To date, these marine studies have predominantly focused on rudimentary metrics describing the spatial and environmental context of their study region (e.g., geographical distance, average sea surface temperature, average salinity). We contend that a more nuanced and considered approach to quantifying seascape dynamics and patterns can strengthen population genomic investigations and help identify spatial, temporal, and environmental factors associated with differing selective regimes or demographic histories. Nevertheless, approaches for quantifying marine landscapes are complicated. Characteristic features of the marine environment, including pe-lagic living in flowing water (experienced by most marine taxa at some point in their life cycle), re-quire a well-designed spatial-temporal sampling strategy and analysis. Many genetic summary statistics used to describe populations may be inappropriate for marine species with large population sizes, large species ranges, stochastic recruitment, and asymmetrical gene flow. Finally, statistical approaches for testing associations between seascapes and population genomic patterns are still maturing with no single approach able to capture all relevant considerations. None of these issues are completely unique to marine systems and therefore similar issues and solutions will be shared for many organisms regardless of habitat. Here, we outline goals and spatial approaches for land-scape genomics with an emphasis on marine systems and review the growing empirical literature on seascape genomics. We review established tools and approaches and highlight promising new stra-tegies to overcome select issues including a strategy to spatially optimize sampling. Despite the many challenges, we argue that marine systems may be especially well suited for identifying candi-date genomic regions under environmentally mediated selection and that seascape genomic approaches are especially useful for identifying robust locus-by-environment associations.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes that shape patterns of genetic structure across space is a central aim of landscape genetics. However, it remains unclear how geographic features and environmental variables shape gene flow, particularly for marine species in large complex seascapes. Here, we evaluated the genomic composition of the two-band anemonefish Amphiprion bicinctus across its entire geographic range in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, as well as its close relative, Amphiprion omanensis endemic to the southern coast of Oman. Both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea are complex and environmentally heterogeneous marine systems that provide an ideal scenario to address these questions. Our findings confirm the presence of two genetic clusters previously reported for A. bicinctus in the Red Sea. Genetic structure analyses suggest a complex seascape configuration, with evidence of both Isolation by Distance (IBD) and Isolation by Environment (IBE). In addition to IBD and IBE, genetic structure among sites was best explained when two barriers to gene flow were also accounted for. One of these coincides with a strong oligotrophic-eutrophic gradient at around 16-20ËN in the Red Sea. The other agrees with an historical bathymetric barrier at the straight of Bab al Mandab. Finally, these data support the presence of inter-specific hybrids at an intermediate suture zone at Socotra and indicate complex patterns of genomic admixture in the Gulf of Aden with evidence of introgression between species. Our findings highlight the power of recent genomic approaches to resolve subtle patterns of gene flow in marine seascapes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Thanks to genome-scale diversity data, present-day studies can provide a detailed view of how natural and cultivated species adapt to their environment and particularly to environmental gradients. However, due to their sensitivity, up-to-date studies might be more sensitive to undocumented demographic effects such as the pattern of migration and the reproduction regime. In this study, we provide guidelines for the use of popular or recently developed statistical methods to detect footprints of selection. We simulated 100 populations along a selective gradient and explored different migration models, sampling schemes and rates of self-fertilization. We investigated the power and robustness of eight methods to detect loci potentially under selection: three designed to detect genotype-environment correlations and five designed to detect adaptive differentiation (based on F(ST) or similar measures). We show that genotype-environment correlation methods have substantially more power to detect selection than differentiation-based methods but that they generally suffer from high rates of false positives. This effect is exacerbated whenever allele frequencies are correlated, either between populations or within populations. Our results suggest that, when the underlying genetic structure of the data is unknown, a number of robust methods are preferable. Moreover, in the simulated scenario we used, sampling many populations led to better results than sampling many individuals per population. Finally, care should be taken when using methods to identify genotype-environment correlations without correcting for allele frequency autocorrelation because of the risk of spurious signals due to allele frequency correlations between populations.},

abstract = {Isolation by distance (IBD) has been a common measure of genetic structure among populations and is based on Euclidean distances among populations. Whereas IBD does not incorporate geographic complexity (e.g. dispersal barriers, corridors) that may better predict genetic structure, a new approach (landscape genetics) joins landscape ecology with population genetics to better model genetic structure. Should IBD be set aside or should it persist as the most simple model in landscape genetics? We evaluated the status of IBD by collecting and analyzing results of 240 IBD data sets among diverse taxa and study systems. IBD typically represented a low proportion of variance in genetic structure (mean r2=0.22) in part because many studies included relatively few populations (mean=11). The number of populations studied (N) was asymptotically related to IBD significance; a study with 9 populations has only 50{\%} probability of significance, while one with {\textgreater} 23 populations will have 90{\%} probability of significance. Surprisingly, ectothermic animals were significantly (p=0.0018) more likely to have significant IBD than endotherms, which suggests a metabolic basis underlying gene flow rates. We also observed marginally significant effects on IBD significance for a) taxa in general and b) dispersal modes within actively-dispersing endotherms. Other factors analyzed (genetic markers, genetic distances, habitats, active or passive dispersal, plant growth form) did not significantly affect IBD, likely related to typical N. For multiple reasons we conclude that IBD should continue as the simplest reference standard against which all other, more complex models should be compared in landscape genetics research.},

abstract = {Aim: Isolation by distance (IBD) analyses are an effective tool for determining genetic connectivity among populations, providing a basis for estimating dispersal and thus contributing to spatial biodiversity planning. Here, we use an IBD approach to determine patterns of connectivity to infer dispersal distances for a phylogenetically diverse range of marine species. Location: Two thousand and eight hundred kilometre of South African coastline. Methods: mtDNA data sets for 11 rocky shore and reef-dwelling marine species with diverse life history strategies (broadcast spawning, brooding and live-bearing) were used to quantify intraspecific genetic connectivity by means of global and pairwise $\Phi$st. Mantel tests were used to assess the significance of genetic structure with geographic distance. Significant, positive slopes were used to estimate dispersal distances. For all species, we also plotted genetic diversity along the coast and compared this to patterns of species richness. Results: For seven of the 11 species tested, we report positive IBD relationships, with patterns of IBD of similar magnitude in broadcast spawners and live-bearers. Dispersal estimates were low, with effective distances of {\textless} 10 km per generation. We find discordance between pelagic larval development and population structure and that genetic structure and the physio-geographic features of the coastline considered to be important biogeographic barriers do not overlap. Genetic diversity and species richness show congruent patterns, with both variables lowest on the west coast, and increasing towards the east. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the complexity of marine systems and the clear need for regional assessments of connectivity, rather than more general management plans which may not otherwise effectively encompass area-specific conservation needs. Importantly, we show that the current marine protected area (MPA) network in South Africa is not effective in protecting evolutionary processes and strongly recommend a network of more closely spaced MPAs in the region that reflects the low average connectivity between distant marine populations.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T In the North-east Atlantic Ocean there are 550 inshore and offshore MPAs established to accomplish a high diversity of objectives, which can be classified into 24 different types of MPA designations. Only 153 of these MPAs have a management plan (MgP) âthe basic tool required for an effective management. Amongst these, only 66 are actually managed, i.e. they have the staff and resources required to operate the plan. A common characteristic of these MPAs is the lack of standardized indicators of their performance. In order to address this issue, an alternative approach was developed based on the assessment of management performance using the expert knowledge and perceptions of managers operating MPAs, a universal source of information that could allow overcoming the usual gaps due to the restrictions in coverage of scientific monitoring and assessments. MgPs showed differences among countries but were homogeneous within each country, reflecting the usual top-down approach in the establishment of MPAs. Compliance with the qualitative objectives present in MgPs was higher than compliance with quantitative ones (87{\%} versus 50{\%}), and the MPAs that most successfully achieved their objectives were those with regular monitoring. This analysis also shows that beyond these objectives, the establishment of an MPA and the activities developed as a consequence of its creation have a positive socio-economic impact on the local human community.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population connectivity, which is essential for the persistence of benthic marine metapopulations, depends on how life history traits and the environment interact to influence larval production, dispersal and survival. Although we have made significant advances in our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of these individual processes, developing an approach that integrates the entire population connectivity process from reproduction, through dispersal, and to the recruitment of individuals has been difficult. We present a population connectivity modelling framework and diagnostic approach for quantifying the impact of i) life histories, ii) demographics, iii) larval dispersal, and iv) the physical seascape, on the structure of connectivity and metapopulation dynamics. We illustrate this approach using the subtidal rocky reef ecosystem of Port Phillip Bay, were we provide a broadly-applicable framework of population connectivity and quantitative methodology for evaluating the relative importance of individual factors in determining local and system outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The spatial characteristics of marine population connectivity are primarily influenced by larval mortality, the duration of the pelagic larval stage, and the settlement competency characteristics, with significant variability imposed by the geographic setting and the timing of larval release. The relative influence and the direction and strength of the main effects were strongly consistent among 10 connectivity-based metrics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These important intrinsic factors (mortality, length of the pelagic larval stage, and the extent of the precompetency window) and the spatial and temporal variability represent key research priorities for advancing our understanding of the connectivity process and metapopulation outcomes.},

abstract = {Many coral reef populations exist as discrete habitat patches linked through larval dispersal into a larger network. On these reefs, organisms spawn periodically and release propagules over a range of frequencies. Biophysical models of larval transport examine marine networks, yet particle release frequency needs careful consideration. We describe the time between sequential spawning events as the release interval and define any linkage of modeled larvae between two habitat sites as a connection. We investigate how changing the release interval affects the connectivity networks of three Caribbean species with low- to high-dispersal potential and swimming behavior. We find that spawning periodicity controls the number and persistence of network connections. Further, larval vertical movement behavior stabilizes the network, significantly increasing connections and connection persistence. This work demonstrates the impact of release interval on connectivity networks and underscores including larval behavior with realistic spawning periodicity in biophysical models of larval transport.},

@article{Cudney-Bueno2009,
abstract = {Marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as conservation and fishery management tools. It is argued that they can protect ecosystems and also benefit fisheries via density-dependent spillover of adults and enhanced larval dispersal into fishing areas. However, while evidence has shown that marine reserves can meet conservation targets, their effects on fisheries are less understood. In particular, the basic question of if and over what temporal and spatial scales reserves can benefit fished populations via larval dispersal remains unanswered. We tested predictions of a larval transport model for a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico, via field oceanography and repeated density counts of recently settled juvenile commercial mollusks before and after reserve establishment. We show that local retention of larvae within a reserve network can take place with enhanced, but spatially-explicit, recruitment to local fisheries. Enhancement occurred rapidly (2 yrs), with up to a three-fold increase in density of juveniles found in fished areas at the downstream edge of the reserve network, but other fishing areas within the network were unaffected. These findings were consistent with our model predictions. Our findings underscore the potential benefits of protecting larval sources and show that enhancement in recruitment can be manifested rapidly. However, benefits can be markedly variable within a local seascape. Hence, effects of marine reserve networks, positive or negative, may be overlooked when only focusing on overall responses and not considering finer spatially-explicit responses within a reserve network and its adjacent fishing grounds. Our results therefore call for future research on marine reserves that addresses this variability in order to help frame appropriate scenarios for the spatial management scales of interest.},

abstract = {Quantifying the probability of larval exchange among marine populations is key to predicting local population dynamics and optimizing networks of marine protected areas. The pattern of connectivity among populations can be described by the measurement of a dispersal kernel. However, a statistically robust, empirical dispersal kernel has been lacking for any marine species. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to quantify a dispersal kernel for the reef fish Elacatinus lori, demonstrating that dispersal declines exponentially with distance. The spatial scale of dispersal is an order of magnitude less than previous estimatesâthe median dispersal distance is just 1.7 km and no dispersal events exceed 16.4 km despite intensive sampling out to 30 km from source. Overlaid on this strong pattern is subtle spatial variation, but neither pelagic larval duration nor direction is associated with the probability of successful dispersal. Given the strong relationship between distance and dispersal, we show that distance-driven logistic models have strong power to predict dispersal probabilities. Moreover, connectivity matrices generated from these models are congruent with empirical estimates of spatial genetic structure, suggesting that the pattern of dispersal we uncovered reflects long-term patterns of gene flow. These results challenge assumptions regarding the spatial scale and presumed predictors of marine population connectivity. We conclude that if marine reserve networks aim to connect whole communities of fishes and conserve biodiversity broadly, then reserves that are close in space ({\textless}10 km) will accommodate those members of the community that are shortdistance dispersers.},

abstract = {Well-designed and effectively managed networks of marine reserves can be$\backslash$neffective tools for both fisheries management and biodiversity$\backslash$nconservation. Connectivity, the demographic linking of local populations$\backslash$nthrough the dispersal of individuals as larvae, juveniles or adults, is$\backslash$na key ecological factor to consider in marine reserve design, since it$\backslash$nhas important implications for the persistence of metapopulations and$\backslash$ntheir recovery from disturbance. For marine reserves to protect$\backslash$nbiodiversity and enhance populations of species in fished areas, they$\backslash$nmust be able to sustain focal species (particularly fishery species)$\backslash$nwithin their boundaries, and be spaced such that they can function as$\backslash$nmutually replenishing networks whilst providing recruitment subsidies to$\backslash$nfished areas. Thus the configuration (size, spacing and location) of$\backslash$nindividual reserves within a network should be informed by larval$\backslash$ndispersal and movement patterns of the species for which protection is$\backslash$nrequired. In the past, empirical data regarding larval dispersal and$\backslash$nmovement patterns of adults and juveniles of many tropical marine$\backslash$nspecies have been unavailable or inaccessible to practitioners$\backslash$nresponsible for marine reserve design. Recent empirical studies using$\backslash$nnew technologies have also provided fresh insights into movement$\backslash$npatterns of many species and redefined our understanding of connectivity$\backslash$namong populations through larval dispersal. Our review of movement$\backslash$npatterns of 34 families (210 species) of coral reef fishes demonstrates$\backslash$nthat movement patterns (home ranges, ontogenetic shifts and spawning$\backslash$nmigrations) vary among and within species, and are influenced by a range$\backslash$nof factors (e.g. size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics,$\backslash$nseason, tide and time of day). Some species move {\textless}0.1-0.5 km (e.g.$\backslash$ndamselfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes), {\textless}0.5-3 km (e.g. most$\backslash$nparrotfishes, goatfishes and surgeonfishes) or 3-10 km (e.g. large$\backslash$nparrotfishes and wrasses), while others move tens to hundreds (e.g. some$\backslash$ngroupers, emperors, snappers and jacks) or thousands of kilometres (e.g.$\backslash$nsome sharks and tuna). Larval dispersal distances tend to be {\textless}5-15 km,$\backslash$nand self-recruitment is common. Synthesising this information allows us,$\backslash$nfor the first time, to provide species, specific advice on the size,$\backslash$nspacing and location of marine reserves in tropical marine ecosystems to$\backslash$nmaximise benefits for conservation and fisheries management for a range$\backslash$nof taxa. We recommend that: (i) marine reserves should be more than$\backslash$ntwice the size of the home range of focal species (in all directions),$\backslash$nthus marine reserves of various sizes will be required depending on$\backslash$nwhich species require protection, how far they move, and if other$\backslash$neffective protection is in place outside reserves; (ii) reserve spacing$\backslash$nshould be {\textless}15 km, with smaller reserves spaced more closely; and (iii)$\backslash$nmarine reserves should include habitats that are critical to the life$\backslash$nhistory of focal species (e.g. home ranges, nursery grounds, migration$\backslash$ncorridors and spawning aggregations), and be located to accommodate$\backslash$nmovement patterns among these. We also provide practical advice for$\backslash$npractitioners on how to use this information to design, evaluate and$\backslash$nmonitor the effectiveness of marine reserve networks within broader$\backslash$necological, socioeconomic and management contexts.},

STRUCTURE can identify subsets of the whole sample by detecting allele frequency differences within the data and can assign individuals to those sub-populations based on analysis of likelihoods. The review covers STRUCTURE's most commonly used ancestry and frequency models, plus an overview of the main applications of the software in human genetics including case-control association studies (CCAS), population genetics, and forensic analysis. The review is accompanied by supplementary material providing a step-by-step guide to running STRUCTURE. METHODS With reference to a worked example, we explore the effects of changing the principal analysis parameters on STRUCTURE results when analyzing a uniform set of human genetic data. Use of the supporting software: CLUMPP and distruct is detailed and we provide an overview and worked example of STRAT software, applicable to CCAS. CONCLUSION The guide offers a simplified view of how STRUCTURE, CLUMPP, distruct, and STRAT can be applied to provide researchers with an informed choice of parameter settings and supporting software when analyzing their own genetic data.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In planktonic dispersers, impediments to dispersal, local selection or large variance in the reproductive success among individuals (sweepstakes reproductive success) can create genetic heterogeneity at local scales. While these processes are well recognized, relatively few studies have investigated the spatial scales over which genetic heterogeneity occurs and how it is distributed across species' ranges. We investigate population structure in the western rock lobster Panulirus cygnus, a commercially exploited species found in shallow and deep-water reef habitats along the Western Australia coastline. We screened 631 individuals from 9 locations across the species' range for genetic variation at 22 microsatellite loci. Consistent with expectations of extensive larval mixing during an extended planktonic stage, we found no significant genetic differentiation among locations (FST = 0.003, G''ST = 0.007). Despite the lack of large-scale geographic structure, small but significant positive spatial autocorrelation (SA) was detected over distances up to 40 km. Two-dimensional local SA analysis confirmed that fine-scale genetic heterogeneity was common throughout the species' range. An intriguing aspect of these results is that SA was based on juvenile and adult lobsters, suggesting restricted movement or spatial cohesion of individuals after settlement.},

Maximum-parsimony analysis, using a hermit crab, Pagurus pollicaris (infraorder Anomura), as an outgroup, produced a tree topology in which Homarus and Nephrops formed a well-supported clade that excluded Homarinus. The same tree topology was obtained from both neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood analyses. Some morphological characters that appear synapomorphic for Nephrops and Metanephrops may be due to convergence rather than symplesiomorphy. The current taxonomy, therefore, does not reflect the phylogeny of this group as suggested by the molecular data. More molecular data and studies using homologous morphological characters are needed to reach a better understanding of the phylogenetic history of clawed lobsters.},

abstract = {Comparative phylogeographic investigations have identified congruent phylogeographic breaks in co-distributed species in nearly every region of the world. The qualitative assessments of phylogeographic patterns traditionally used to identify such breaks, however, are limited because they rely on identifying monophyletic groups across species and do not account for coalescent stochasticity. Only long-standing phylogeographic breaks are likely to be obvious; many species could have had a concerted response to more recent landscape events, yet possess subtle signs of phylogeographic congruence because ancestral polymorphism has not completely sorted. Here we introduce Phylogeographic Concordance Factors (PCFs), a novel method for quantifying phylogeographic congruence across species. We apply this method to the Sarracenia alata pitcher plant system, a carnivorous plant with a diverse array of commensal organisms. We explore whether a group of ecologically associated arthropods have co-diversified with the host pitcher plant, and identify if there is a positive correlation between ecological interaction and PCFs. Results demonstrate that multiple arthropods share congruent phylogeographic breaks with S. alata, and provide evidence that the level of ecological association can be used to predict the degree of similarity in the phylogeographic pattern. This study outlines an approach for quantifying phylogeographic congruence, a central concept in biogeographic research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are patchily distributed ecosystems inhabited by specialized animal populations that are textbook meta-populations. Many vent-associated species have free-swimming, dispersive larvae that can establish connections between remote populations. However, connectivity patterns among hydrothermal vents are still poorly understood because the deep sea is undersampled, the molecular tools used to date are of limited resolution, and larval dispersal is difficult to measure directly. A better knowledge of connectivity is urgently needed to develop sound environmental management plans for deep-sea mining. Here, we investigated larval dispersal and contemporary connectivity of ecologically important vent mussels (Bathymodiolus spp.) from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by using high-resolution ocean modeling and population genetic methods. Even when assuming a long pelagic larval duration, our physical model of larval drift suggested that arrival at localities more than 150 km from the source site is unlikely and that dispersal between populations requires intermediate habitats ("phantom" stepping stones). Dispersal patterns showed strong spatiotemporal variability, making predictions of population connectivity challenging. The assumption that mussel populations are only connected via additional stepping stones was supported by contemporary migration rates based on neutral genetic markers. Analyses of population structure confirmed the presence of two southern and two hybridizing northern mussel lineages that exhibited a substantial, though incomplete, genetic differentiation. Our study provides insights into how vent animals can disperse between widely separated vent habitats and shows that recolonization of perturbed vent sites will be subject to chance events, unless connectivity is explicitly considered in the selection of conservation areas. Assessment of contemporary connectivity in hydrothermal vents is critical for a thorough understanding of vent biology and the mitigation of environmental impacts from deep-sea mining. In contrast to previous assumptions, Breusing et al. show that connections between mid-Atlantic vent mussel populations can only be achieved via stepping-stone habitats.},

abstract = {Seascape genetics is the study of how spatially variable structural and environmental features influence genetic patterns of marine organisms. Seascape genetics is conceptually linked to landscape genetics and this likeness frequently allows investigators to use similar theoretical and analytical methods for both seascape genetics and landscape genetics. But, the physical and environmental attributes of the ocean and biological attributes of organisms that live in the sea, especially the large spatial scales of seascape features and the high dispersal ability of many marine organisms, differ from those of terrestrial organisms that have typified landscape genetic studies. This paper reviews notable papers in the emerging field of seascape genetics, highlighting pervasive themes and biological attributes of species and seascape features that affect spatial genetic patterns in the sea. Similarities to, and differences from, (terrestrial) landscape genetics are discussed, and future directions are recommended.},

abstract = {Aim We develop the first global model of connectivity for a generic broadcast spawning coral, and compare the results to connectivity estimates from genetic studies, general biogeographic patterns and theories. We also derive various âconnectivity indices' describing relative isolation and source potential between locations. Location Modelled oceans 47Â°âSâ47Â°âN. Methods Dispersal of model coral âlarvae' was simulated over 8 years using an individual-based biophysical dispersal model driven by 1/12Â°-resolution surface ocean current data and incorporating individual trait variability (e.g. a phased pre-competency period). Source and arrival locations of modelled larvae on suitable reef habitat gave standardized dispersal paths and relative levels of connectivity. Results In the model c. 50{\%} of connections occurred within 50â100âkm, with rarer dispersal between regions linking entire oceans in a âstepping stone' fashion. The central Pacific was an almost complete barrier to dispersal, only rarely breached westward from the Galapagos to Marquesas Islands. Areas showing strong isolation also included Hawaii, Easter Island, the Red Sea and the eastern Atlantic. The Indo-West Pacific and Great Barrier Reef showed the highest levels of connectivity, with secondary peaks in the western Indian Ocean, corresponding to areas of enriched coral diversity. The central Indo-Pacific diversity hotspot was overall a greater source than sink for dispersal. Conclusions This study provides a global view of connectivity that complements genetic and biogeographic work as well as providing a number of novel findings relevant to biogeographic theories (e.g. the central Indo-Pacific as a dispersal source; Johnston Atoll as the sole âstepping-stone' into Hawaii). Discrepancies with proposed connectivity patterns (e.g. one-way, westward, connectivity across the central Pacific) present hypotheses for future research. The model represents an effective tool for exploring the factors controlling connectivity on this scale and the effects of climate change on future connectivity, and will also aid predictions of future reef distributions.},

abstract = {Seascape genetics, a term coined in 2006, is a fast growing area of population genetics that draws on ecology, oceanography and geography to address challenges in basic understanding of mar- ine connectivity and applications to management. We provide an accessible overview of the latest develop- ments in seascape genetics that merge exciting new ideas from the field of marine population connectivity with statistical and technical advances in population genetics. After summarizing the historical context leading to the emergence of seascape genetics, we detail questions and methodological approaches that are evolving the discipline, highlight applications to conservation and management, and conclude with a summary of the field's transition to seascape ge- nomics. From 100 seascape genetic studies, we assess trends in taxonomic and geographic coverage, sam- pling and statistical design, and dominant seascape drivers. Notably, temperature, oceanography and geo - graphy show equal prevalence of influence on spatial genetic patterns, and tests of over 20 other seascape factors suggest that a variety of forces impact connec- tivity at distinct spatio-temporal scales. A new level of rigor in statistical analysis is critical for disentangling multiple drivers and spurious effects. Coupled with GIS data and genomic scale sequencing methods, this rigor is taking seascape genetics beyond an initial focus on identifying correlations to hypothesis-driven insights into patterns and processes of population connectivity and adaptation. The latest studies are illuminating differences between demographic, func- tional and neutral genetic connectivity, and informing applications to marine reserve design, fisheries sci- ence and strategies to assess resilience to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts.},

abstract = {Adults and larvae of the European lobster, \textit{Homarus gammarus}, were studied within and around the Swedish Ka Ëvra lobster reserve (2.2 km2). Tagging of 4016 lobsters within the reserve showed that the lobsters have limited movement out of the reserve. Only 58 lobsters (1.4{\%} of all tagged lobsters) were recaptured â¥1 km from the reserve and 5658 recaptures were obtained inside the reserve. Light trap catches showed that stage 1 larvae had a peak occurrence during ,2 weeks, in early August, 2007â2009. The mean depth distribution of stage 1 larvae was 16 m and very few larvae were found in the low saline surface layer. No later stages were found in horizontal net tows. The lobsters inside the reserve provided stage 1 larvae to the nearby area. A persistent retention of water masses was found at 16-m depth (below the sharp halocline) in the area (16 km2) around the reserve using IMR GPS Current Drifters. In sharp contrast, surface drifters showed strong offshore and inshore movements. The Swedish archipelago might harbour many lobster and other decapod subpopulations, if the larval stages occur in a large proportion below the sharp halocline and if adult movements are limited.},

abstract = {Following a global coral bleaching event in 1998, Acropora corals surrounding most of Okinawa island (OI) were devastated, although they are now gradually recovering. In contrast, the Kerama Islands (KIs) only 30 km west of OI, have continuously hosted a great variety of healthy corals. Taking advantage of the decoded Acropora digitifera genome and using genome-wide SNP analyses, we clarified Acropora population structure in the southern Ryukyu Archipelago (sRA). Despite small genetic distances, we identified distinct clusters corresponding to specific island groups, suggesting infrequent long-distance dispersal within the sRA. Although the KIs were believed to supply coral larvae to OI, admixture analyses showed that such dispersal is much more limited than previously realized, indicating independent recovery of OI coral populations and the necessity of local conservation efforts for each region. We detected strong historical migration from the Yaeyama Islands (YIs) to OI, and suggest that the YIs are the original source of OI corals. In addition, migration edges to the KIs suggest that they are a historical sink population in the sRA, resulting in high diversity. This population genomics study provides the highest resolution data to date regarding coral population structure and history.},

abstract = {Historically, hatcheries in Europe and North America attempted to contribute to the conservation and enhancement of clawed lobster stocks, but lacked monitoring programmes capable of assessing success. In the 1990s, this perspective was changed by the results of restocking and stock enhancement experiments that inserted microwire tags into hatchery-reared juvenile European lobsters (\textit{Homarus gammarus}) before release. This allowed recapture in sufficient numbers to prove that lobsters had survived and recruited to the mature fishable stock. However, evidence of recruitment still failed to answer key questions about the ultimate ecological and economic benefits. As a result, a growing number of lobster stocking ventures remain hindered by a lack of clear evidence of the effects of their stocking schemes. This review evaluates these experiments and related studies on other fished species, summarizes key findings, and identifies data and knowledge gaps. Although studies of fitness in cultured lobsters provide some of the most encouraging results from the wider field of hatchery-based stocking, the limitations of physical tagging technology have significantly hindered appraisals of stocking impacts. We lack basic knowledge of lobster ecology and population dynamics, especially among prerecruits, and of the impact of stocking on wild lobster population genetics. We advocate the use of genetic methods to further our understanding of population structure, rearing processes, and stocking success. We also recommend that more focused and comprehensive impact assessments are required to provide a robust endorsement or rejection of stocking as a viable tool for the sustainable management of lobster fisheries.},

The sex ratio did not significantly differ from 1:1. Oogenesis lasted 13â17 months, beginning between February and June, and ending with the release of 0.7 planula larvae per polyp between late May and July of the following year. The diameter of mature oocytes ranged 450â860mm. Spermatogenesis was much shorter than oogenesis and occurred over 5â6 months. Gonadal production of both sexes increased in spring and culminated with the spawning of male colonies in late MayâJune. Fertilization of oocytes and development of the planula larvae occurred within the polyps of female colonies. Planula release was observed in June and July. The patterns emerging from this and previous studies on sexual reproduction of Mediterranean gorgonians suggest that investment in gonad development appears to be related to resource availability.},

abstract = {Gorgonian species show a high morphological variability in relation to the environment in which they live. In coastal areas, parameters such as temperature, light, currents, and food availability vary significantly with depth, potentially affecting morphology of the colonies and the structure of the populations, as well as their connectivity patterns. In tropical seas, the existence of connectivity between shallow and deep populations supported the hypothesis that the deep coral reefs could potentially act as (reproductive) refugia fostering re-colonization of shallow areas after mortality events. Moreover, this hypothesis is not so clear accepted in temperate seas. Eunicella singularis is one of the most common gorgonian species in Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, playing an important role as ecosystem engineer by providing biomass and complexity to the coralligenous habitats. It has a wide bathymetric distribution ranging from about 10 m to 100 m. Two depth-related morphotypes have been identified, differing in colony morphology, sclerite size and shape, and occurrence of symbiotic algae, but not in mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. In the present study the genetic structure of E. singularis populations along a horizontal and bathymetric gradient was assessed using microsatellites and ITS1 sequences. Restricted gene flow was found at 30â40 m depth between the two Eunicella morphotypes. Conversely, no genetic structuring has been found among shallow water populations within a spatial scale of ten kilometers. The break in gene flow between shallow and deep populations contributes to explain the morphological variability observed at different depths. Moreover, the limited vertical connectivity hinted that the refugia hypothesis does not apply to E. singularis. Re-colonization of shallow water populations, occasionally affected by mass mortality events, should then be mainly fueled by larvae from other shallow water populations.},

abstract = {The integration of ecological and evolutionary data is highly valuable for conservation planning. However, it has been rarely used in the marine realm, where the adequate design of marine protected areas (MPAs) is urgently needed. Here, we examined the interacting processes underlying the patterns of genetic structure and demographic strucuture of a highly vulnerable Mediterranean habitat-forming species (i.e. Paramuricea clavata (Risso, 1826)), with particular emphasis on the processes of contemporary dispersal, genetic drift, and colonization of a new population. Isolation by distance and genetic discontinuities were found, and three genetic clusters were detected; each submitted to variations in the relative impact of drift and gene flow. No founder effect was found in the new population. The interplay of ecology and evolution revealed that drift is strongly impacting the smallest, most isolated populations, where partial mortality of individuals was highest. Moreover, the eco-evolutionary analyses entailed important conservation implications for P. clavata. Our study supports the inclusion of habitat-forming organisms in the design of MPAs and highlights the need to account for genetic drift in the development of MPAs. Moreover, it reinforces the importance of integrating genetic and demographic data in marine conservation.},

The present study was designed to analyse population structure and relationships at different spatial scales (from 10s of meters to 100s of kilometres) with a focus on dispersal pattern. We also performed the first analysis of the distribution of genetic diversity using a comparative approach between regional-clusters and samples. Forty populations dwelling in four distinct regions between 14 and 60 m in depth were genotyped using 10 microsatellites. Our main results indicate (i) a generalized pair-sample differentiation combined with a weak structure between regional-clusters; (ii) the occurrence of isolation by distance at the global scale, but also within two of the three analysed regional-clusters; (iii) a high level of genetic diversity over the surveyed area with a heterogeneous distribution from regional-cluster to sample levels. The evolutionary consequences of these results are discussed and their management implications are provided.},

abstract = {A new Bayesian method that uses individual multilocus genotypes to estimate rates of recent immigration (over the last several generations) among populations is presented. The method also estimates the posterior probability distributions of individual immigrant ancestries, population allele frequencies, population inbreeding coefficients, and other parameters of potential interest. The method is implemented in a computer program that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to carry out the estimation of posterior probabilities. The program can be used with allozyme, microsatellite, RFLP, SNP, and other kinds of genotype data. We relax several assumptions of early methods for detecting recent immigrants, using genotype data; most significantly, we allow genotype frequencies to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions within populations. The program is demonstrated by applying it to two recently published microsatellite data sets for populations of the plant species Centaurea corymbosa and the gray wolf species Canis lupus. A computer simulation study suggests that the program can provide highly accurate estimates of migration rates and individual migrant ancestries, given sufficient genetic differentiation among populations and sufficient numbers of marker loci.},

abstract = {1. Spatially explicit Bayesian clustering techniques offer a powerful tool for ecology and wildlife management, as genetic divisions can be correlated with landscape features. We used these methods to analyse the genetic structure of a population of European wild boar Sus scrofa with the aim of identifying effective barriers for disease management units. However, it has been suggested that the methods could produce biased results when faced with deviations from random mating not caused by genetic discontinuities, such as isolation by distance (IBD). 2. We analysed a data set consisting of 697 wild boar multilocus genotypes using spatially explicit (baps, geneland) and non-explicit (structure) Bayesian methods. We also simulated and analysed data sets characterized by different degrees of IBD, with and without genetic discontinuities. 3. When analysing the empirical data set, different programs did not converge on the same clustering solution and some clusters were difficult to explain biologically. Results from the simulated data showed that IBD, also present in the empirical data set, could cause the Bayesian methods to overestimate genetic structure. Simulated barriers were identified correctly, but the programs superimposed further clusters at higher IBD levels. 4. It was not possible to ascertain with confidence whether the clustering solutions offered by the various programs were an accurate reflection of population genetic structure in our empirical data set or were artefacts created by the underlying IBD pattern. 5. Synthesis and applications: We show that Bayesian clustering methods can overestimate genetic structure when analysing an individual-based data set characterized by isolation by distance. This bias could lead to the erroneous delimitation of management or conservation units. Investigators should be critical and suspicious of clusters that cannot be explained biologically. Data sets should be tested for isolation by distance and conclusions should not be based on the output from just one method. -ï¿½ 2009 British Ecological Society},

The time-slice maps of ice-sheet extent are based on a new Geographical Information System (GIS) database, where we have collected published numerical dates constraining the timing of ice-sheet advance and retreat, and additionally geomorphological and geological evidence contained within the existing literature. We integrate all uncertainty estimates into three ice-margin lines for each time-slice; a most-credible line, derived from our assessment of all available evidence, with bounding maximum and minimum limits allowed by existing data. This approach was motivated by the demands of glaciological, isostatic and climate modelling and to clearly display limitations in knowledge. The timing of advance and retreat were both remarkably spatially variable across the ice-sheet area. According to our compilation the westernmost limit along the BritishâIrish and Norwegian continental shelf was reached up to 7000 years earlier (at c. 27â26 ka) than the eastern limit on the Russian Plain (at c. 20â19 ka). The Eurasian ice sheet complex as a whole attained its maximum extent (5.5 Mkm2) and volume ({\~{}}24 m Sea Level Equivalent) at c. 21 ka. Our continental-scale approach highlights instances of conflicting evidence and gaps in the ice-sheet chronology where uncertainties remain large and should be a focus for future research. Largest uncertainties coincide with locations presently below sea level and where contradicting evidence exists.

Data from across taxa reveal distinct regional lineages, which reflect the survival and divergence of populations in isolated savannah refugia during the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene. Data from taxa across trophic levels suggest distinct savannah refugia were present in West, East, Southern and South-West Africa. Furthermore, differing Pleistocene evolutionary biogeographic scenarios are proposed for East and Southern Africa, supported by palaeoclimatic data and the fossil record. Environmental instability in East Africa facilitated several spatial and temporal refugia and is reflected in the high inter- and intraspecific diversity of the region. In contrast, phylogeographic data suggest a stable, long-standing savannah refuge in the south.},

abstract = {Effective population size (N e) is a key parameter in population genetics. It has important applications in evolutionary biology, conservation genetics and plant and animal breeding, because it measures the rates of genetic drift and inbreeding and affects the efficacy of systematic evolutionary forces, such as mutation, selection and migration. We review the developments in predictive equations and estimation methodologies of effective size. In the prediction part, we focus on the equations for populations with different modes of reproduction, for populations under selection for unlinked or linked loci and for the specific applications to conservation genetics. In the estimation part, we focus on methods developed for estimating the current or recent effective size from molecular marker or sequence data. We discuss some underdeveloped areas in predicting and estimating N e for future research. Heredity advance online publication, 29 June 2016; doi:10.1038/hdy.2016.43 INTRODUCTION The concept of effective population size, introduced by Sewall Wright (1931, 1933), is central to plant and animal breeding (Falconer and Mackay, 1996), conservation genetics (Frankham et al., 2010; Allendorf et al., 2013) and molecular variation and evolution (Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 2010), as it quantifies the magnitude of genetic drift and inbreeding in real-world populations. A substantial number of extensions to the basic theory and predictions were made since the seminal work of Wright, with main early developments by James Crow and Motoo Kimura (Kimura and Crow, 1963a; Crow and Kimura, 1970) and later by a list of contributors. Several review papers (Crow and Denniston, 1988; Caballero, 1994; Wang and Caballero, 1999; Nomura, 2005a) and population genetic books (Fisher, 1965; Wright, 1969; Ewens, 1979; Nagylaki, 1992) have summarised the existing theory in predicting the effective size of a population at different spatial and timescales under various inheritance modes and demographies. Comparatively, methodological developments (reviewed by Schwartz et al., 1999; Beaumont, 2003a; Wang, 2005; Palstra and Ruzzante, 2008; Luikart et al., 2010; Gilbert and Whitlock, 2015) in estimating the effective size of natural populations from genetic data lag behind but are accelerating in the past decade, thanks to the rapid developments of molecular biology. The classical developments of effective population size theory are based on the rate of change in gene frequency variance (genetic drift) or the rate of inbreeding. The effective population size is defined in reference to the WrightâFisher idealised population, that is, a hypothetical population with very simplifying characteristics where genetic drift is the only factor in operation, and the dynamics of allelic and genotypic frequencies across generations merely depend on the population census (N) size. The effective size of a real population is then defined as the size of an idealised population, which would give rise to the rate of inbreeding and the rate of change in variance of gene frequencies actually observed in the population under consideration, which correspond to the so-called inbreeding and variance effective sizes, respectively (Crow and Kimura, 1970). Predictions of the effective population size can also be obtained from the largest nonunit eigenvalue of the transition matrix of a Markov Chain which describes the dynamics of allele frequencies. Such derived effective size is called as eigenvalue effective size (see Ewens, 1979, pp. 104â112), which is equivalent to the random extinction effective size (Crow, 1954; see also Haldane, 1939). The transition matrix can be written for many genetic models and is particularly useful for complex scenarios such as populations varying in size, having age structures or being subject to demographic changes (for example, Charlesworth, 2001; Pollak, 2002; Wang and Pollak, 2002; Engen et al., 2005). A less often used approach is that for the mutation effective size, defined by the probability of identity in state of genes rather than identity by descent under an infinite allele model of mutations with a defined mutation rate (Whitlock and Barton, 1997). Later developments based on coalescence theory (Wakeley, 2008) have also proved to be useful in the prediction of effective population size, particularly in the evolutionary context for predicting genetic variability at the molecular level (Charlesworth, 2009; Nicolaisen and Desai, 2012, 2013). The coalescence theory states that the chance of coalescence of any two random gene copies in one generation time is 1/2N, which is the same as the rate of increase in identity by descent occurred from one generation to the next one. Thus, the probability of coalescence t generations ago is (1 â (1/2N)) t â 1 (1/2N). Therefore, the average time of coalescence of two randomly chosen genes is T = 2N. The coalescent effective population size refers to the expected time of coalescence T, in generations, of gene copies such that T = 2N e (Nordborg and Krone, 2002; Wakeley and Sargsyan, 2009). In this paper, we present a general overview of the main develop-ments for predicting the effective population size (N e). The review does not attempt to be exhaustive, and some of the material mentioned in previous reviews will not be repeated. We mainly focus},

abstract = {The field of seascape genetics aims to evaluate the effects of environmental features on spatial genetic patterns of marine organisms. Although many methods of genetic analysis and inference appropriate to ââmarine landscapes'' derive from terrestrial landscape genetics, aspects of marine living introduce special challenges for assessing spatial genetic variation. For instance, marine organisms are often highly dispersive, so that genetic patterns can be subtle, and the temporal variability of the marine environment makes these patterns difficult to characterise. Tools and techniques from oceanography can help describe the highly connected and dynamic nature of the marine environment. In particular, models incorporating physical oceanography and species attributes in realistic simulations (e.g. biophysical models) can help us understand this complex process and formulate spatially explicit biologically-informed predictions of gene flow. Thus, researchers embarking on a seascape genetic study need a solid understanding of marine organisms and spatial genetics perhaps combined with knowledge of physical oceanography and ecological modeling. Although some researchers may acquire proficiency in all of these areas, seascape genetic studies incorporating biophysical modeling are likely to bring together groups of investigators with complementary expertise. This preliminary guide is intended to be a starting point for a reader new to either seascape genetics or biophysical models.},

abstract = {Aim Comparative phylogeography across a large number of species allows investigating community-level processes at regional and continental scales. An effective approach to such studies would involve automatic retrieval of georef- erenced sequence data from nucleotide databases (a first step towards an âauto- mated phylogeography'). It remains unclear if, despite repeated calls, georeferencing of nucleotide databases has increased in frequency, and if accu- mulated data allow for broad applications based on automated retrieval of sequence data and associated geographical information. Here, we investigated geographical information available in NCBI GenBank accessions for tetrapods, exploring temporal and geographical patterns in georeferencing, and quantify- ing data available for automated phylogeography. Location Global. Methods We developed Python and R scripts to (1) download metadata from GenBank (1,125,514 accessions, {\textgreater} 20,000 species); (2) geocode accessions from associated metadata; (3) map originally georeferenced and geocoded accessions and plot their frequency against time; (4) assess the size of intraspecific sets of homologous sequences and compare their geographical extent with species ranges, thus evaluating their potential for phylogeographical analyses. Results Only 6.2{\%} of surveyed tetrapod GenBank submissions reported geo- graphical coordinates, without increase in recent years. Our geocoding raised georeferenced accessions to 15.1{\%}. The geographical distribution of georefer- enced accessions is patchy, and especially sparse in economically underdevel- oped areas. Automatically retrievable informative data sets covering most of the range are available for very few species of wide-ranging tetrapods. Main conclusions Although geocoding offers a partial solution to the scarcity of direct georeferencing, the amount of data potentially useful for automated phylogeography is still limited. Strong underrepresentation of hard-to-access areas suggests that sampling logistics represent a main hindrance to global data availability. We propose that, besides enhancing georeferencing of genetic data, future research agendas should focus on collaborative efforts to sample genetic diversity in biodiversity-rich tropical areas.},

abstract = {Aim The challenge for phylogeography, like other observational sciences, is to extract general relationships representing causes and effects from complex natural data. I describe comparisons of synchronously diverging co-distributed (SDC) taxa, including sympatric sister species, to help meet this challenge. Location Global. Methods As an example, using narrative and best evidence synthesis, I re-evaluate ad hoc aggregate analyses relating population genetic structure (FST) to dispersal potential. I deconstruct an aggregate global analysis to generate a regional subset of data which I compare with datasets describing co-distributed taxa, SDC species and sympatric sister species. Results A weak negative relationship between FST and dispersal potential is implied by aggregate global analysis (0.1 â¤ R2 â¤ 0.29). In contrast, regional datasets of co-distributed species show strong correlation between FST and dispersal potential (0.78 â¤ R2 â¤ 0.85). Comparisons between SDC and sympatric sister species consistently evince higher gene flow in species with higher dispersal potential. Main conclusions Ad hoc aggregate analyses can be compromised by multiple sources of error. Comparisons of SDC taxa, including sympatric sister species, adapt the experimental scientific method to natural situations, providing robust and repeatable tests of phylogeographic hypotheses and accurate estimates of effect sizes. To make strong inferences about phylogeography we should seek out the hidden wealth of natural experiments that provide particularly clear opportunities to study the factors that influence patterns of biodiversity. The SDC framework enables independent tests of existing hypotheses, integration of independent studies in meta-analyses across taxa and regions, and identification of general trends versus location- or taxon-specific phenomena. Coupled with advances in statistical phylogeography, species distribution modelling and palaeoecology, the SDC framework bridges the long-standing gap between observational and experimental sciences.},

abstract = {When divergence occurs in the presence of gene flow, there can arise an interesting dynamic in which selection against gene flow, at sites associated with population-specific adaptations or genetic incompatibilities, can cause net gene flow to vary across the genome. Loci linked to sites under selection may experience reduced gene flow and may experience genetic bottlenecks by the action of nearby selective sweeps. Data from histories such as these may be poorly fitted by conventional neutral model approaches to demographic inference, which treat all loci as equally subject to forces of genetic drift and gene flow. To allow for demographic inference in the face of such histories, as well as the identification of loci affected by selection, we developed an isolation-with-migration model that explicitly provides for variation among genomic regions in migration rates and/or rates of genetic drift. The method allows for loci to fall into any of multiple groups, each characterized by a different set of parameters, thus relaxing the assumption that all loci share the same demography. By grouping loci, the method can be applied to data with multiple loci and still have tractable dimensionality and statistical power. We studied the performance of the method using simulated data, and we applied the method to study the divergence of two subspecies of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).},

abstract = {Level and partitioning of genetic diversity is expected to vary between contrasting habitats, reflecting differences in strength of ecological and evolutionary processes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider processes acting on different time scales when trying to explain diversity patterns in different parts of species' distributions. To explore how historical and contemporary factors jointly may influence patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation, we compared genetic composition in the perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea from the northernmost parts of its distribution range on Iceland to that previously documented in Scandinavia. Leaf tissue and soil were sampled from ten Icelandic populations of A. lyrata. Seedlings were grown from soil samples, and tissue from above-ground and seed bank individuals were genotyped with 21 microsatellite markers. Seed bank density in Icelandic populations was low but not significantly different from that observed in Norwegian populations. While within-population genetic diversity was relatively high on Iceland (HE = 0.35), among-population differentiation was low (FST = 0.10) compared to Norwegian and Swedish populations. Population differentiation was positively associated with geographical distance in both Iceland and Scandinavia, but the strength of this relationship varied between regions. Although topography and a larger distribution range may explain the higher differentiation between mountainous Norwegian relative to lowland populations in Sweden, these factors cannot explain the lower differentiation in Icelandic compared to Swedish populations. We propose that low genetic differentiation among Icelandic populations is not caused by differences in connectivity, but is rather due to large historical effective population sizes. Thus, rather than contemporary processes, historical factors such as survival of Icelandic lineages in northern refugia during the last glacial period may have contributed to the observed pattern.},

abstract = {Many single-species freshwater phylogeographic studies have been carried out in south-east Queensland; however comparative phylogeography requires multiple lines of evidence to infer deep, significant relationships between landscape and biota. The present study aimed to test conclusions resulting from single taxon studies in a multispecies comparative framework: (1) how influential are river basins in the genetic structure of freshwater species; (2) are there biogeographic frontiers between groups of basins; and (3) could deep intraspecific lineages be explained by a single event? New and existing data from 33 freshwater species (23 fishes and 10 crustaceans) were combined, and both standard single-species analyses (haplotype networks, genetic distances, $\Phi$ST) and multispecies methods (hierarchical ABC) were carried out for 1814 sequences from eight basins. More than half of the species displayed a high phylogeographic structure and contained at least two distinct lineages. Almost all of the lineage divergences displayed an element of north/south geographic breaks, with the most influential boundary being between the Mary and Brisbane rivers. Of the 11 basin-pair multispecies coalescent analyses, four implied a single divergence as being most likely. A regional analysis of deep lineages within 16 taxon-pairs resulted in a strongly supported inference of a single divergence, probably dating to the Pleistocene. Basin boundaries are a key determinant of phylogeographic patterns for most of these freshwater species, although the specific biogeographic relationship between basins often varies depending on the species. There are a number of influential biogeographic frontiers, with the Brisbane-Mary being the most important. The finding that a single event may be responsible for multiple deep lineages across the region implies that a highly influential climate change event may have been detected. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Linnean Society of London.},

Here, we present a model-based framework for comparative phylogeography. Our framework was initially developed for statistical phylogeography based on a multi-model inference approach, by coupling ecological niche modeling, coalescent simulation and direct spatio-temporal reconstruction of lineage diffusion using a relaxed random walk model. This multi-model inference framework is particularly useful to investigate the complex dynamics and current patterns in genetic diversity in response to processes operating on multiple taxonomic levels in comparative phylogeography. In addition, because of the lack, or incompleteness of fossil record, the understanding of the role of biogeographical events (vicariance and dispersal routes) in most regions worldwide is barely known. Thus, we believe that the expansion of that framework for multiple species under a comparative approach may give clues on genetic legacies in response to Quaternary climate changes and other biogeographical processes.},

Here, we identified 10Â 944 single-nucleotide polymorphisms using restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to explore population structure, demography, and adaptive divergence in five populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from western Alaska. Patterns of population structure were similar to those of past studies, but our ability to assign individuals back to their region of origin was greatly improved ({\textgreater}90{\%} accuracy for all populations). We also calculated effective size with and without removing physically linked loci identified from a linkage map, a novel method for nonmodel organisms. Estimates of effective size were generally above 1000 and were biased downward when physically linked loci were not removed. Outlier tests based on genetic differentiation identified 733 loci and three genomic regions under putative selection. These markers and genomic regions are excellent candidates for future research and can be used to create high-resolution panels for genetic monitoring and population assignment.

abstract = {Determining the genetic structure of populations is becoming an increasingly important aspect of genetic studies. One of the most frequently used methods is the calculation of F-statistics using an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA). However, this has the drawback that the population hierarchy has to be known a priori. Therefore, the population structure is often based on the results of a clustering analysis. Here I show how these two steps, clustering and calculation of F-statistics, can be combined in a single analysis. I do this by showing how the AMOVA framework is theoretically related to the widely used method of K-means clustering and can be used for the clustering of populations into groups. Simulations were used to show that the method performed very well both under random mating and under nonrandom mating. However, when the migration rates were high, the results were better under random mating than under predominant selfing or clonal reproduction. Two summary statistics were tested for estimating the number of clusters. Overall, pseudo-F showed the better performance, but BIC is better for detecting whether any significant structure is present. The results show that the AMOVA-based K-means clustering is useful for clustering population genetic data. Programs to perform the clustering can be downloaded from www.patrickmeirmans.com/software.},

abstract = {Identifying microevolutionary processes acting in populations of marine species with larval dispersal is a challenging but crucial task because of its conservation implications. In this context, recent improvements in the study of spatial genetic structure (SGS) are particularly promising because they allow accurate insights into the demographic and evolutionary processes at stake. Using an exhaustive sampling and a combination of image processing and population genetics, we highlighted significant SGS between colonies of Corallium rubrum over an area of half a square metre, which sheds light on a number of aspects of its population biology. Based on this SGS, we found the mean dispersal range within sites to be between 22.6 and 32.1 cm, suggesting that the surveyed area approximately corresponded to a breeding unit. We then conducted a kinship analysis, which revealed a complex half-sib family structure and allowed us to quantify the level of self-recruitment and to characterize aspects of the mating system of this species. Furthermore, significant temporal variations in allele frequencies were observed, suggesting low genetic drift. These results have important conservation implications for the red coral and further our understanding of the microevolutionary processes acting within populations of sessile marine species with a larval phase.},

abstract = {Understanding dispersal pathways and population connectivity is an essential prerequisite for devising effective fishery management strategies in at least two critical ways. The first concerns the delineation of appropriate spatial scales for management, while the second involves specification of subareas that are to be protected from exploitation and that are nested within broader management units. An understanding of dispersal patterns at all life-history stages is crucial to meeting both objectives. Spatial management units are typically defined on the basis of genetic structure, differences in morphological and demographic characteristics, fishing patterns, and/or movement and dispersal patterns of individual species (Cadrin et al., 2004). Classical models employed in single-species management typically assume that the population is well mixed throughout the management area. Today, our enhanced ability to resolve finer-scale population structure and patterns of connectivity with refined monitoring programs and advances in genetic techniques, elemental fingerprinting, and other tools (see Hedgecock et al., this issue; Thorrold et al., this issue) reveals the need to adopt a metapopulation perspective in which subpopulations linked through dispersal at one or more points in the life cycle comprise the management unit (Kritzer and Sale, 2006). Spatially explicit harvesting strategies that involve both seasonal and longterm closures of fishing grounds, and whose objectives are to protect nursery areas or spawning aggregations and enhance yield, have an extensive history and remain widely employed in marine fishery management (Kruse et al., 2002). Moreover, increasing concern over the status of marine resources and ecosystems under escalating anthropogenic stress has led to calls for a more holistic strategy for ocean management that incorporates broader ecosystem principles (e.g., U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, 2004). The use of networks of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)âareas of the ocean protected from one or more forms of human disturbanceâis strongly advocated as a tactical management tool in this context (NRC, 2001). Particular interest centers on the potential utility of no-take marine reserves (a form of MPA) in which all extractive activities are prohibited. Here, the objective is to preserve ecosystem structure and function. The reserve concept therefore extends the traditional form of fishery closures to encompass wider objectives, more inclusive protection, and in many cases, broader time horizons (Fogarty et al., 2000).},

abstract = {Networks of no-take reserves are important for protecting coral reef biodiversity from climate change and other human impacts. Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This âârepresentation'' objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the  location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential   tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.},

We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self-recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the demographic history of populations is a central issue in evolutionary biology. Using likelihood-based methods coupled with Monte Carlo simulations, it is now possible to reconstruct past changes in population size from genetic data. Using simulated data sets under various demographic scenarios, we evaluate the statistical performance of Msvar, a full-likelihood Bayesian method that infers past demographic change from microsatellite data. Our simulation tests show that Msvar is very efficient at detecting population declines and expansions, provided the event is neither too weak nor too recent. We further show that Msvar outperforms two moment-based methods (the M-ratio test and Bottleneck) for detecting population size changes, whatever the time and the severity of the event. The same trend emerges from a compilation of empirical studies. The latest version of Msvar provides estimates of the current and the ancestral population size and the time since the population started changing in size. We show that, in the absence of prior knowledge, Msvar provides little information on the mutation rate, which results in biased estimates and/or wide credibility intervals for each of the demographic parameters. However, scaling the population size parameters with the mutation rate and scaling the time with current population size, as coalescent theory requires, significantly improves the quality of the estimates for contraction but not for expansion scenarios. Finally, our results suggest that Msvar is robust to moderate departures from a strict stepwise mutation model.},

abstract = {The global decline in coral reefs demands urgent management strategies to protect resilience. Protecting ecological connectivity, within and among reefs, and between reefs and other ecosystems is critical to resilience. However, connectivity science is not yet able to clearly identify the specific measures for effective protection of connectivity. This article aims to provide a set of principles or practical guidelines that can be applied currently to protect connectivity. These ârules of thumb' are based on current knowledge and expert opinion, and on the philosophy that, given the urgency, it is better to act with incomplete knowledge than to wait for detailed understanding that may come too late. The principles, many of which are not unique to connectivity, include: (1) allow margins of error in extent and nature of protection, as insurance against unforeseen or incompletely understood threats or critical processes; (2) spread risks among areas; (3) aim for networks of protected areas which are: (a) comprehensive and spreadâprotect all biotypes, habitats and processes, etc., to capture as many possible connections, known and unknown; (b) adequateâmaximise extent of protection for each habitat type, and for the entire region; (c) representativeâmaximise likelihood of protecting the full range of processes and spatial requirements; (d) replicatedâmultiple examples of biotypes or processes enhances risk spreading; (4) protect entire biological units where possible (e.g. whole reefs), including buffers around core areas. Otherwise, choose bigger rather than smaller areas; (5) provide for connectivity at a wide range of dispersal distances (within and between patches), emphasising distances {\textless}20â30 km; and (6) use a portfolio of approaches, including but not limited to MPAs.

Colonies of P. clavata were collected from 39 locations across the Mediterranean Sea from Morocco to Turkey and analysed using microsatellite loci. Within three regions (Medes, Marseille and North Corsica), sampling was obtained from multiple locations and at different depths. Three different approaches (measures of genetic differentiation, Bayesian clustering and spatially explicit maximum-difference algorithm) were used to determine the pattern of genetic structure. We identified genetic breaks in the spatial distribution of genetic diversity, which were concordant with oceanographic conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. We revealed a high level of genetic differentiation among populations and a pattern of isolation by distance across the studied area and within the three regions, underlining short effective larval dispersal in this species. We observed genetic differentiation among populations in the same locality dwelling at different depths, which may be explained by local oceanographic conditions and which may allow a process of local adaptation of the populations to their environment. We discuss the implications of our results for the conservation of the species, which is exposed to various threats.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Substrate, ocean current and freshwater discharge are recognized as important factors that control the larval dispersal and recruitment of intertidal species. Life history traits of individual species will determine the differential responses to these physical factors, and hence resulting in contrasting phylogeography across the same biogeographic barrier. To determine how these factors affect genetic structure of rocky shore species along the China coast, a comparative phylogeographic study of four intertidal and subtidal species was conducted using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA by combining new sequences from Siphonaria japonica with previously published sequences from three species (Cellana toreuma, Sargassum horneri and Atrina pectinata).RESULTS:Analysis of molecular variance and pairwise PhiST revealed significant genetic differences between the Yellow Sea (YS) and the other two marginal seas (East China Sea, ECS and South China Sea, SCS) for rocky-shore species (S. japonica, C. toreuma, S. horneri), but not for muddy-shore species Atrina pectinata. Demographic history analysis proved that the population size of all these four species were persistent though the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, {\~{}}20ka BP). Migration analysis revealed that gene flow differentiated northward and southward migration for these four species. However, the inferred direction of gene flow using alternatively mitochondrial or nuclear markers was contradictory in S. japonica.CONCLUSIONS:It is concluded that there is a phylogeographical break at the Yangtze River estuary for the rocky shore species and the causation of the barrier is mainly due to the unsuitable substratum and freshwater discharge. All four intertidal and subtidal species appear to have persisted through the LGM in China, indicating the lower impact of LGM on intertidal and subtidal species than generally anticipated. The imbalanced gene flow between YS and ESCS groups for these four species could be explained by historical refugia. The discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers in the MIGRATE analysis of S. japonica prove the importance of employing multi-locus data in biogeographic study. Climate change, land reclamation and dam construction, which are changing substrate and hydrological conditions around Yangtze River estuary, will consequently affect the biogeographic pattern of intertidal species.},

abstract = {The desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea during the Messinian Salinity Crisis 6.0-5.3 million years ago (Ma), caused a major extinction of the marine ichthyofauna of the Mediterranean. This was followed by an abrupt replenishment of the Mediterranean from the Atlantic after the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. In this study, we combined demographic and phylogeographic approaches using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers to test the alternative hypotheses of where (Atlantic or Mediterranean) and when (before or after the Messinian Salinity Crisis) speciation occurred in the Mediterranean damselfish, Chromis chromis. The closely related geminate transisthmian pair Chromis multilineata and Chromis atrilobata was used as a way of obtaining an internally calibrated molecular clock. We estimated C. chromis speciation timing both by determining the time of divergence between C. chromis and its Atlantic sister species Chromis limbata (0.93-3.26 Ma depending on the molecular marker used, e.g. 1.23-1.39 Ma for the control region), and by determining the time of coalescence for C. chromis based on mitochondrial control region sequences (0.14-0.21 Ma). The time of speciation of C. chromis was always posterior to the replenishment of the Mediterranean basin, after the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Within the Mediterranean, C. chromis population structure and demographic characteristics revealed a genetic break at the Peloponnese, Greece, with directional and eastbound gene flow between western and eastern groups. The eastern group was found to be more recent and with a faster growing population (coalescent time = 0.09-0.13 Ma, growth = 485.3) than the western group (coalescent time = 0.13-0.20 Ma, growth = 325.6). Our data thus suggested a western origin of C. chromis, most likely within the Mediterranean. Low sea water levels during the glacial periods, the hydrographic regime of the Mediterranean and dispersal restriction during the short pelagic larval phase of C. chromis (18-19 days) have probably played an important role in C. chromis historical colonization.},

abstract = {We examined 733 individuals of Fucus spiralis from 21 locations and 1093 Fucus vesiculosus individuals from 37 locations throughout their northern hemisphere ranges using nuclear and mitochondrial markers. Three genetic entities of F. spiralis were recovered. In northern and sympatric populations, the presence of " F. spiralis Low" in the mid-intertidal and " F. spiralis High" in the high-intertidal was confirmed and both co-occurred with the sister species F. vesiculosus. The third and newly-discovered entity, " F. spiralis South", was present mainly in the southern range, where it did not co-occur with F. vesiculosus. The South entity diverged early in allopatry, then hybridized with F. vesiculosus in sympatry to produce F. spiralis Low. Ongoing parallel evolution of F. spiralis Low and F. spiralis High is most likely due to habitat preference/local selection and maintained by preferentially selfing reproductive strategies. Contemporary populations of F. spiralis throughout the North Atlantic stem from a glacial refugium around Brittany involving F. spiralis High; F. spiralis South was probably unaffected by glacial episodes. Exponential population expansion for F. vesiculosus began during the Cromer and/Holstein interglacial period (300,000-200,000. yrs BP). Following the last glacial maximum (30,000-22,000. yrs BP), a single mtDNA haplotype from a glacial refugium in SW Ireland colonized Scandinavia, the Central Atlantic islands, and the W Atlantic. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent glaciation covered the full extent of rocky intertidal habitat along the coasts of New England and the Canadian Maritimes. To test whether this glaciation in fact caused wholesale extinction of obligate rocky intertidal invertebrates, and thus required a recolonization from Europe, we compared American and European populations using allelic diversity and techniques adapted from coalescent theory. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were collected from amphi-Atlantic populations of three cold-temperate obligate rocky intertidal species (a barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, and two gastropods, Nucella lapillus and Littorina obtusata) and three cold-temperate habitat generalist species (a seastar, Asterias rubens; a mussel, Mytilus edulis, and an isopod, Idotea balthica). For many of these species we were able to estimate the lineage-specific mutation rate based on trans-Arctic divergences between Pacific and Atlantic taxa. These data indicate that some obligate rocky intertidal taxa have colonized New England from European populations. However, the patterns of persistence in North America indicate that other life-history traits, including mech anisms of dispersal, may be more important for surviving dramatic environmental and climatic change.},

abstract = {G(ST) and its relatives are often interpreted as measures of differentiation between subpopulations, with values near zero supposedly indicating low differentiation. However, G(ST) necessarily approaches zero when gene diversity is high, even if subpopulations are completely differentiated, and it is not monotonic with increasing differentiation. Likewise, when diversity is equated with heterozygosity, standard similarity measures formed by taking the ratio of mean within-subpopulation diversity to total diversity necessarily approach unity when diversity is high, even if the subpopulations are completely dissimilar (no shared alleles). None of these measures can be interpreted as measures of differentiation or similarity. The derivations of these measures contain two subtle misconceptions which cause their paradoxical behaviours. Conclusions about population differentiation, gene flow, relatedness, and conservation priority will often be wrong when based on these fixation indices or similarity measures. These are not statistical issues; the problems persist even when true population frequencies are used in the calculations. Recent advances in the mathematics of diversity identify the misconceptions, and yield mathematically consistent descriptive measures of population structure which eliminate the paradoxes produced by standard measures. These measures can be directly related to the migration and mutation rates of the finite-island model.},

Various plotting tools are also provided for a visual evaluation of estimated values, allowing users to critically assess the validity and significance of statistical tests froma biological perspective. 2. diveRsity has a set of unique features, which facilitate the use of an informed framework for assessing the validity of the use of traditional F-statistics for the inference of demography, with reference to specific marker types, particularly focusing on highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. However, the package can be readily used for other co-dominantmarker types (e.g. allozymes, SNPs). 3. Detailed examples of usage and descriptions of package capabilities are provided. The examples demonstrate useful strategies for the exploration of data and interpretation of results generated by diveRsity.

abstract = {Tools for estimating population structure from genetic data are now used in a wide variety of applications in population genetics. However, inferring population structure in large modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges. Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a dataset and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data, and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias towards detecting structure when it is very weak. Our algorithm, fastSTRUCTURE, is freely available online at http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html.},

abstract = {Abstract. Genetic analyses of marine population structure often find only slight geographic differentiation in species with high dispersal potential. Interpreting the significance of this slight genetic signal has been difficult because even mild genetic structure implies very limited demographic exchange between populations, but slight differentiation could also be due to sampling error. Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2â5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25â150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well. $\backslash$nKey words: connectivity; dispersal; isolation by distance; larvae; population structure.},

Egg-bearing females collected in situ just after spawning in late summer were subjected to various seasonal temperature regimes. Regimes with elevated temperatures (mild winters) resulted in a strong seasonal forward shift of larval hatching. Hatching took place at significantly lower temperatures than under regimes with normal winters. Experiments on larval development across a range of constant temperatures showed that no successful larval development occurred at temperatures below 14Â°C. Larval survival increased from 9{\%} at 14Â°C to 80{\%} at 22Â°C, while duration of larval development decreased correspondingly from 26 to 13 days. We hypothesize that an ongoing warming of the North Sea will strongly affect the recruitment success of the Helgoland lobster, mainly resulting from a decoupling of the seasonal peak appearance of larvae from optimal external conditions (temperature, food availability) for larval development.},

Spatial patterns in recruitment density at the sampling sites were positively correlated among years (r2 = 0.82) and did not appear to be related to distribution patterns of postlarvae. It seems likely that habitat type substantially influenced benthic recruitment patterns. Moreover, local differences in recruitment density of the first cohort were conserved over the 2 seasons of observation, supporting earlier assertions that new recruits are relatively sedentary. We develop a simple diagnostic model of the pelagic-to-benthic transition in lobster recruitment that accounts for the increase in density by 2 orders of magnitude from postlarval to benthic (recruit) stage, and we use this model to suggest plausible rates of postlarval diving and settlement that describe average and site specific recruitment in the 2 years.$\backslash$n},

First, we demonstrate a high level of residency and survival (50{\%}) for almost a year (363 days) within MPAs, despite small MPA sizes (0.5-1 km(2)). Second, we demonstrate limited export (4.7{\%}) of lobsters tagged within MPAs (N = 1810) to neighbouring fished areas, over a median distance of 1.6 km out to maximum 21 km away from MPA centres. In comparison, median movement distance of lobsters recaptured within MPAs was 164 m, and recapture rate was high (40{\%}). Third, we demonstrate a high level of gene flow within the study region, with an estimated F ST of less than 0.0001 over a â 400 km coastline. Thus, the restricted movement of older life stages, combined with a high level of gene flow suggests that connectivity is primarily driven by larval drift. Larval export from the MPAs can most likely affect areas far beyond their borders. Our findings are of high importance for the design of MPA networks for sedentary species with pelagic early life stages.},

abstract = {By means of an RAPD analysis, the degree of genetic variation in the European lobster, \textit{Homarus gammarus}, was assessed. We focused our attention on the Helgoland population. which is isolated by its geographical location. By comparison with seven other European lobster populations we demonstrated that the Helgoland lobster is genetically widely separated from other European lobster stocks. However, ail populations investigated showed high values of genetic distance, indicating that genetic exchange among European populations of \textit{Homarus gammarus} may be restricted. The European lobster populations appeared to be isolated by distance since the pattern of genetic relationships reflects their geographic location. We thus suggest a distinct, genetical population structure, possibly maintained by genetic drift within relatively isolated local populations and restricted gene flow between them. This contrasts to the homogeneous population structure of the American lobster, Homarus americanus.},

abstract = {The aim of this survey was to test a standardised method to follow the demographic evolution of a dense aggregative âforest' population of the temperate gorgonian Eunicella verrucosa (Octocorallia, Gorgoniidae) using in situ photographic recordings. Distribution, density, growth and demographic evolution of the colonies was compared along two parallel transects. Computer treatment allowed the estimation of the total branch fan surface area, and the individual growth of tagged colonies was determined by measuring the increase in this surface area, using consecutive photographs taken at two-year intervals. To integrate the potential bias of branch overlapping, we proposed a correction factor between the in situ photographic surface area and the surface area of the gorgonian calculated from ex situ photographic surface area with all branches deployed. The surface-frequency distribution of colonies was converted to estimated-age-frequency distribution using an estimated growth curve based on the net growth rate. The technique used revealed significant differences in population structure and the dynamics of gorgonian colonies, as the two transects appeared to be influenced by different environmental conditions. The recruitment also seemed to vary according to year and transect, resulting in different densities. Our work showed clear results in characterising the variations of gorgonian demographic evolution at a small spatial scale; thus, it is assumed that this method could be a sustainable tool for coastal environmental managers.},

abstract = {Population structure is the result of both present processes and past history. Molecular markers are proving of great value in describing the former, and it is important to similarly determine the latter in order to understand their respective contributions. The study of palaeo-climates has also advanced significantly, and in particular that of the Pleistocene ice ages, which modified species ranges considerably. The last ice age and rapid post-glacial colonization of Europe is summarized. Possible population genetic consequences of expansion northward from southern refugia, and those of remaining in these mountainous regions are discussed. A series of recent case studies are detailed where DNA sequence information has been used to describe species genetic variation and subdivision across Europe. These include a grasshopper, the hedgehog, oak trees, the common beech, the black alder, the brown bear, newts, shrews, water vole, silver fir and house mice. These molecular data confirm southern peninsulas of Europe as major ice age refugia, and in most cases demonstrate that genetically distinct taxa emerged from them. They can thus define genomic differences and so gready augment previous fossil data. The refugial genomes contributed differently in various species to die re-colonization of Europe, with three broad patterns described as paradigmsââgrasshopper', âhedgehog' and âbear'. These different expansion patterns produced clusters of hybrid zones where they made contact, and it is argued that many species genomes may be further cryptically subdivided. A reduction in diversity from southern to northern Europe in the extent of allelic variation and species subdivision is seen; this is attributed to rapid expansion northward and the varied topography of southern refugia allowing populations to diverge through several ice ages. The differences in DNA sequence indicate that some species have been diverging in refugial regions for a few ice ages at most, whilst distinct lineages in other species suggest much more ancient separation.},

Atlantic bluefin tuna mtDNA is polyphyletic, and includes rare sequences sister to Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) and introgressed albacore (Thunnus alalunga) sequences. There is no geographic partitioning between Atlantic and Mediterranean samples of Atlantic bluefin tuna (??ST = 0.002). In contrast, Atlantic and Mediterranean swordfish are differentiated (??ST = 0.091) due to the combined effects of vicariance, secondary contact, and dissimilar regional demographic histories. Mediterranean swordfish has substantially less variation, and a more recent history (?? = 2.42) than that of Atlantic swordfish (?? = 7.02). In spite of the discordant phylogenetic and phylogeographic signals, the demographic history of Atlantic swordfish and Atlantic bluefin tuna (?? = 7.51) suggests concordance in the timeline of population expansion. Possible scenarios of cladogenesis, expansion, and contraction, influenced by glacial cycles during the Pleistocene, are formulated. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mtDNA variation of 198 Aleuts, as well as North American and Asian populations drawn from the literature, were analyzed to reconstruct the Aleuts' genetic prehistory and to investigate their role in the peopling of the Circumarctic region. From median-joining network analysis, three star-like clusters were identified in the Aleuts within the following subhaplogroups: A3, A7 (an Aleut-specific subclade of A3), and D2. Mismatch analyses, neutrality test scores, and coalescent time estimates for these three components provided evidence of two expansion events, one occurring at approximately 19,900 B.P. and the other at 5,400 B.P. Based on these findings and evidence from the archaeological data, four general models for the genetic prehistory of the Aleutian Island chain are proposed: 1) biological continuity involving a kin-structured peopling of the archipelago; 2) intrusion and expansion of a non-native biface-producing population dominated by subhaplogroup D2; 3) amalgamation of Arctic Small Tool tradition peoples characterized by D2 with an older Anangula substratum; and 4) biological continuity with significant gene flow from neighboring populations of the Alaskan mainland and Kodiak Island. The Aleut mtDNAs are consistent with the Circumarctic pattern by the fixation of A3 and D2, and the exhibition of depressed diversity levels relative to Amerind and Siberian groups. The results of this study indicate a broad postglacial reexpansion of Na-Dene and Esko-Aleuts from reduced populations within northern North America, with D2 representing a later infusion of Siberian mtDNAs into the Beringian gene pool.},

abstract = {Phylogeography is a young, vigorous and integrative field of study that uses genetic data to understand the history of populations. This field has recently expanded into many areas of biology and also into several historical disciplines of Earth sciences. In this review, I present a numerical synthesis of the phylogeography literature based on an examination of over 3000 articles published during the first 20 years of the field (i.e. from 1987 to 2006). Information from several topics needed to evaluate the progress, tendencies and deficiencies of the field is summarized for 10 major groups of organisms and at a global scale. The topics include the geography of phylogeographic surveys, comparative nature of studies, temporal scales and major environments investigated, and genetic markers used. I also identify disparities in research productivity between the developing and the developed world, and propose ways to reduce some of the challenges faced by phylogeographers from less affluent countries. Phylogeography has experienced explosive growth in recent years fuelled by developments in DNA technology, theory and statistical analysis. I argue that the intellectual maturation of the field will eventually depend not only on these recent developments, but also on syntheses of comparative information across different regions of the globe. For this to become a reality, many empirical phylogeographic surveys in regions of the Southern Hemisphere (and in developing countries of the Northern Hemisphere) are needed. I expect the information and views presented here will assist in promoting international collaborative work in phylogeography and in guiding research efforts at both regional and global levels.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory is primed to synthesize microevolutionary processes with macroevolutionary divergence by taking advantage of multilocus multispecies genomic data in the molecular evolutionary analysis of biodiversity. While coalescent theory bridges across timescales to facilitate this integration, it is important to appreciate the assumptions, caveats, and recent theoretical advances so as to most effectively exploit genomic analysis. Here I outline the connections between population processes and phylogeny, with special attention to how genomic features play into underlying predictions. I discuss empirical and theoretical complications, and solutions, relating to recombination and multifurcating genealogical processes, predictions about how genome structure affects gene tree heterogeneity, and practical choices in genome sequencing and analysis. I illustrate the conceptual implications and practical benefits of how genomic features generate predictable patterns of discordance of gene trees and species trees along genomes, for example, as a consequence of how regions of low recombination and sex linkage interact with natural selection and with the accumulation of reproductive incompatibilities in speciation. Moreover, treating population genetic parameters as characters to be mapped onto phylogenies offers a new way to understand the evolutionary drivers of diversity within and differentiation between populations. Despite a number of challenges conferred by genomic information, the melding of phylogenetics, phylogeography and population genetics into integrative molecular evolution is poised to improve our understanding of biodiversity at all levels. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Elemental fingerprinting-based research conducted over the past 12 years along the open coastline and bays of San Diego County in southern California evaluated connectivity patterns for seven species: one native and two invasive mussels, an oyster, a brachyuran crab, and two fishes. The studies spanned different years and seasons but overlapped considerably in space, allowing comparisons of dispersal patterns across species, and assessment of the relative importance of location, circulation, and intra-annual and inter-annual variability. We asked whether the species exhibited commonalities in directional transport, transport distances, sources and sinks, self-recruitment, and bay-ocean exchange. Linked connectivity-demographic analyses conducted for two species of mytilid mussels and two fishes allowed evaluation of the contributions of realized connectivity to metapopulation dynamics relative to other life-history attributes. Common trends across species include average along-shore dispersal distances of 15-35 km and seasonal changes in direction of dispersal that mirrored patterns of along-shore circulation. We observed greater isolation of back-bay populations, significant exchange from front bay to ocean, and high self-recruitment in locations on the northern, open coast, and in the southern bays. Connectivity was rarely the most influential driver of growth and persistence of metapopulations, but influenced the importance of other vital rates. Several locations served consistently as sources of larvae or as nurseries for multiple species, but there were few sites in common that were sinks. For the mussels, reproductive timing guided directional transport. These results imply that local management (e.g., habitat protection, opening of the mouths of lagoons, location of aquaculture farms) may be effective along this coastline. Regional, multi-species assessments of exchange of larvae should move us closer to ecosystem-based management.},

Appl. 13: S159-S169), providing information on 67 species. PD and dispersal distance are correlated, but with many exceptions. The distribution of dispersal distances was bimodal. Many species with PDs longer than 1 day dispersed less than 1 km, while others dispersed tens to hundreds of kilometers. Organisms with short dispersal distances were pelagic briefly or remained close to the bottom while pelagic. Null models of passively dispersing propagules adequately predict dispersal distance for organisms with short PDs ({\textless}1 day), but overestimate dispersal distances for those with longer PDs. These models predict that propagules are transported tens of kilometers offshore; however, many types remain within the coastal boundary layer where currents are slower and more variable, leading to lower than predicted dispersal. At short PDs, dispersal distances estimated from genetic data are similar to observed. At long PDs, genetic data generally overestimate dispersal distance. This discrepancy is probably due to the effect of rare individuals that disperse long distances, thus smoothing genetic differences between populations. Larval behavior and species' life-history traits can play a critical role in determining dispersal distance.},

abstract = {Increasing dispersal duration should result in increasing dispersal distance, facilitating higher gene flow among populations. As such, it has long been predicted that genetic structure (e.g. F(ST) ) among populations of marine species should be strongly correlated with pelagic larval duration (PLD). However, previous studies have repeatedly shown a surprisingly poor correspondence. This result has been frequently interpreted as evidence for larval behaviours or physical oceanographic processes that result in larvae failing to reach their dispersal potential, or error inherent in estimating PLD and F(ST) . This study employed a computer modelling approach to explore the impacts of various uncertainties on the correlation between measures of genetic differentiation such as F(ST) and PLD. Results indicate that variation resulting from PLD estimation error had minor impacts on the correlation between genetic structure and PLD. However, variation in effective population size between species, errors in F(ST) estimation and non-equilibrium F(ST) values all had major impacts, resulting in dramatically weaker correlations between PLD and F(ST) . These results suggest that poor correlations between PLD and F(ST) may result from variation and uncertainty in the terms associated with the calculation of F(ST) values. As such, PLD may be a much stronger determinant of realized larval dispersal than suggested by the weak-to-moderate correlations between PLD and F(ST) reported in empirical studies.},

abstract = {Connectivity among populations determines the dynamics and evolution of populations, and its assessment is essential in ecology in general and in conservation biology in particular. The robust basis of any ecological study is the accurate delimitation of evolutionary units, such as populations, metapopulations and species. Yet a disconnect still persists between the work of taxonomists describing species as working hypotheses and the use of species delimitation by molecular ecologists interested in describing patterns of gene flow. This problem is particularly acute in the marine environment where the inventory of biodiversity is relatively delayed, while for the past two decades, molecular studies have shown a high prevalence of cryptic species. In this study, we illustrate, based on marine case studies, how the failure to recognize boundaries of evolutionary-relevant unit leads to heavily biased estimates of connectivity. We review the conceptual framework within which species delimitation can be formalized as falsifiable hypotheses and show how connectivity studies can feed integrative taxonomic work and vice versa. Finally, we suggest strategies for spatial, temporal and phylogenetic sampling to reduce the probability of inadequately delimiting evolutionary units when engaging in connectivity studies.},

abstract = {Contemporary patterns of genetic diversity and population connectivity within species can be influenced by both historical and contemporary barriers to gene flow. In the marine environment, present day oceanographic features such as currents, fronts and upwelling systems can influence dispersal of eggs/larvae and/juveniles/adults, shaping population substructuring. The Benguela Current system in the southeastern Atlantic is one of the oldest upwelling systems in the world, and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relative influence of contemporary and historical mechanisms shaping the evolutionary history of warm-temperate fish species. Using the genetic variation in the mitochondrial DNA Control Region and eight nuclear microsatellite DNA loci, we identified the presence of two highly divergent populations in a vagile and warm-temperate fish species, Atractoscion aequidens, across the Benguela region. The geographical distributions of the two populations, on either side of the perennial upwelling cell, suggest a strong correlation between the oceanographic features of the system and the breakdown of gene flow within this species. Genetic divergence (mtDNA $\phi$ ST = 0.902, microsatellite F ST = 0.055: probability of genetic homogeneity for either marker = p{\textless}0.001), absence of migrants (less than 1{\%} per generation) between populations and coalescent estimates of time since most recent common ancestor suggest that the establishment of the main oceanographic features of the system (2 million years ago), particularly the strengthening and position of the perennial upwelling cell, is the most likely mechanism behind the observed isolation. Concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers indicates that isolation and divergence of the northern and southern Benguela populations of A. aequidens occurred deep in the past and has continued to the present day. These findings suggest that the Benguela Current system may constitute an ancient and impermeable barrier to gene flow for warm-temperate fish species.},

abstract = {Understanding connectivity remains a fundamental challenge to marine ecology due to technical limitations of tracking larval dispersal. Marine population genetic analyses are often used to make inferences about the scale of population connectivity. For species with a larval phase, pelagic larval duration (PLD) is assumed to influence the scale of connectivity. If PLD and genetic metrics are reliable proxies of connectivity, the 2 should be well correlated. Previous tests report conflicting results, with many reports that global F-ST (Wright's fixation index) correlates poorly with PLD, and one very high correlation of isolation-by-distance (IBD) slope, which is derived from F-ST, with PLD. First we clarify the expectations for the performance of these different proxies in light of the latest understanding of larval dispersal dynamics. We then test the hypothesis that IBD slope may be a more robust correlate with dispersal scale than global F-ST with a new dataset of recent marine genetic studies. Re-evaluation of previously published and new datasets revealed a consistent, moderate fit (R-2 similar to 0.30) between genetic and PLD proxies of dispersal (using either IBD slope or global F-ST), with significant improvement for small-scale ({\textless}650 km) studies (R-2 = 0.50), and important effects of marker type. Significant effects of number of individuals and number of populations sampled on the genetic metrics in our dataset suggest a common need for more robust sampling designs. These results synchronize previous studies on this topic and provide validation that PLD and genetic metrics typically reflect scales of dispersal, as intended, at least when sampling design is robust.},

The integration of population size estimates and demographic dynamics as well as individual behaviour (embracing aspects like dispersal behaviour) allows for testing of adaptations to local environments and understanding time-lags frequently observed in molecular data.

abstract = {Predicting connectivity patterns in systems with fluid transport requires descriptions of the spatial distribution of propagules. In contrast to research on terrestrial seed dispersal, where much attention has focused on localized physical factors affecting dispersal, studies of oceanic propagule dispersal have often emphasized the role of large-scale factors. We link these two perspectives by exploring how propagule dispersal in the ocean is influenced by the "coastal boundary layer" (CBL), a region of reduced velocities near the shoreline that might substantially modify local-scale dispersal. We used a simple simulation model to demonstrate that accounting for the CBL markedly alters transport distances, the widths of dispersal distributions, and the fraction of larvae retained near their sites of origin (self-retention). Median dispersal distances were up to 59{\%} shorter in simulations with a CBL than in those without. Self-retention of larvae increased by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the presence of CBLs, but only minor changes arose in the long-distance tails of the distributions, resulting in asymmetric, non-Gaussian kernels analogous to those quantified for terrestrial seed dispersal. Because successfully settling larvae are commonly those that remain close to shore and interact with the CBL, ignoring this pervasive oceanographic feature will substantially alter predictions of population self-persistence, estimates of connectivity, and outcomes of metapopulation analyses.},

abstract = {A major challenge in marine ecology is describing patterns of larval dispersal and population connectivity, as well as their underlying processes. We used a biophysical model to simulate dispersal of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, larvae and connectivity among a network of 10 no-take reserves in a shallow, wind-driven estuary to assess the relative importance of spawning location, spawning date, larval behavior, larval mortality, and adult reproductive output to predicted dispersal and connectivity patterns. The location (i.e., natal reserve) and date of spawning relative to physical processes, particularly frequency of wind reversals, were the dominant drivers of dispersal and connectivity patterns. To a lesser extent, larval behavior (i.e., 3D vertical advection and ontogenetic depth regulation) and mortality modified dispersal and connectivity, whereas spatiotemporal variability in adult reproductive output was of minimal importance. Over a 21-day larval duration, mean dispersal distance of passive surface particles ranged from 5 to 40 km. Reserves were too small (1 km2) relative to mean dispersal distances to promote extensive local retention (median 2{\%}) and spaced too far apart (typically {\~{}}50 km) to promote extensive inter-reserve connectivity (median 2{\%}). Limited connectivity and local retention may preclude the network from being selfsustainable, thereby limiting its long-term conservation and management benefits. In reserve systems characterized by limited connectivity, management efforts should focus on increasing connectivity by increasing the number or size of reserves to realize the benefits of improved adult demographics within reserves.},

abstract = {Estuarine recruitment of fishes is a potential bottleneck in the life cycle of many coastal species. We investigated patterns of size-at-ingress for larval and post-larval California halibut entering the Punta Banda Estuary (PBE), Mexico, using both otolith geochemistry and carbon stable isotope ratios (SIR). Juvenile halibut (n = 126; 38-163 mm standard length [SL]) were collected from inside PBE and the adjacent exposed coast during the fall of 2003, and otoliths (geochemistry) and muscle tissues (SIR) were analyzed to reconstruct the environmental histories of individuals. Based on geochemical analyses, nearly all fish collected from PBE were characterized by a non-estuarine signature (e.g., low Mn and Ba) in the otolith growth bands deposited when fish were {\textless} 30 mm SL. Although fish collected from the coast retained that signature throughout their lives, fish collected within PBE showed elevated concentrations of Mn and Ba in the otolith growth bands deposited once halibut were 30-70 mm SL, thereby recording ingress. Carbon SIR of juvenile halibut prey also differed between the estuary and coast. Muscle delta C-13 values of halibut captured along the coast were consistent (ca.-15aEuro degrees), while those captured in the estuary were variable and generally more enriched in C-13 (-16aEuro degrees to -11aEuro degrees). Both natural tagging approaches agreed that most halibut (similar to 75 {\%}) enter PBE long after settlement ({\textgreater} {\textgreater} 8-12 mm SL), although size-at-ingress estimates were significantly larger (mean difference = 27 mm; p {\textless} 0.001) when derived via carbon SIR than with otolith geochemistry. Potential explanations for the differences in size-at-ingress estimates involve the magnitude of isotopic and trace element gradients at this ocean-estuary boundary, the temporal resolution of environmental tags stored within otoliths and soft tissues, and the size-at-capture or somatic growth rate of juvenile halibut. We conclude by discussing the relative merits of otolith geochemistry and SIR as natural tags, and by considering the implications of secondary dispersal into estuaries by post-larval fish.},

Using 12 presentations given in a workshop on âImproving participation for better governance of MPAs' at the 3rd International Marine Protected Areas Congress in October 2013, this paper reviews a range of top-down, bottom-up and collaborative approaches to governance, looking at all phases in the process from design of an MPA network to its implementation, as well as considering individual MPAs. Designation of MPA networks requires significant investment of resources to engage local stakeholders in discussions over potential site location and management measures. Scaling-up from individual MPAs to networks of MPAs will often also require a scaling-up of governance approaches, including top-down approaches. Balancing the need to provide for the participation of local users in each constituent MPA with the need to address a variety of challenges, whilst achieving wider-scale objectives through the inclusion of top-down governance approaches is an important but neglected challenge in discussions concerning MPA networks. These case studies indicate that there are various ways in which this challenge can be addressed in different contexts and point to potential âgood practice' for other MPAs in similar scenarios.},

The program STRUCTURE is commonly used to infer population structure using multi-locus genotype data. However, a tool with graphical-user interface is currently not available to visualize STRUCTURE bar plots.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce STRUCTURE PLOT, a program for drawing STRUCTURE bar plots. The program generates publication ready, aesthetic STRUCTURE bar plots by using individual Q matrix from STRUCTURE or CLUMPP output. The program is very simple to use and includes variety of options like sorting bar by original order or by K, and selection of colors from R colors or RColorBrewer palette. Individual or population labels can be printed below or above the plot in any angle. Size of the graph and label can be defined, and option is provided to save plot in variety of picture formats in user defined resolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The program is implemented as a web application for online users and also as a standalone shiny application. Web application is compatible to majority of leading web browsers and standalone version can be launched using a simple R command.

It is found that the polymorphic patterns in a DNA sample under logistic population growth and genetic hitchhiking are very similar and that one of the newly developed tests, Fs, is considerably more powerful than existing tests for rejecting the hypothesis of neutrality of mutations. Background selection gives rise to quite different polymorphic patterns than does logistic population growth or genetic hitchhiking, although all of them show excesses of rare alleles or young mutations. We show that Fu and Li's tests are among the most powerful tests against background selection. Implications of these results are discussed.},

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

The position of the peak reflects the time of the population growth. The signature of an ancient population expansion is apparent even in the low-resolution mtDNA typings described by Merriwether et al. (1991). The smoothness of the mismatch distribution, an indicator of population expansion, is hardly affected by population structure, whereas mean sequence divergence increases in a pooled sample from highly isolated subpopulations.},

These signatures appear in histograms showing the relative frequencies of pairs of individuals who differ by i sites, where i = 0, 1, .... In this distribution an episode of growth generates a wave that travels to the right, traversing 1 unit of the horizontal axis in each 1/2u generations, where u is the mutation rate. The smaller the initial population, the steeper will be the leading face of the wave. The larger the increase in population size, the smaller will be the distribution's vertical intercept. The implications of continued exponential growth are indistinguishable from those of a sudden burst of population growth Bottlenecks in population size also generate waves similar to those produced by a sudden expansion, but with elevated uppertail probabilities. Reductions in population size initially generate L-shaped distributions with high probability of identity, but these converge rapidly to a new equilibrium. In equilibrium populations the theoretical curves are free of waves. However, computer simulations of such populations generate empirical distributions with many peaks and little resemblance to the theory. On the other hand, agreement is better in the transient (nonequilibrium) case, where simulated empirical distributions typically exhibit waves very similar to those predicted by theory. Thus, waves in empirical distributions may be rich in information about the history of population dynamics.},

abstract = {The genomic architecture underlying ecological divergence and ecological speciation with gene flow is still largely unknown for most organisms. One central question is whether divergence is genome-wide or localized in 'genomic mosaics' during early stages when gene flow is still pronounced. Empirical work has so far been limited, and the relative impacts of gene flow and natural selection on genomic patterns have not been fully explored. Here, we use ecotypes of Atlantic cod to investigate genomic patterns of diversity and population differentiation in a natural system characterized by high gene flow and large effective population sizes, properties which theoretically could restrict divergence in local genomic regions. We identify a genomic region of strong population differentiation, extending over approximately 20 cM, between pairs of migratory and stationary ecotypes examined at two different localities. Furthermore, the region is characterized by markedly reduced levels of genetic diversity in migratory ecotype samples. The results highlight the genomic region, or 'genomic island', as potentially associated with ecological divergence and suggest the involvement of a selective sweep. Finally, we also confirm earlier findings of localized genomic differentiation in three other linkage groups associated with divergence among eastern Atlantic populations. Thus, although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown, the results suggest that 'genomic mosaics' of differentiation may even be found under high levels of gene flow and that marine fishes may provide insightful model systems for studying and identifying initial targets of selection during ecological divergence.},

abstract = {In many marine fish species, genetic population structure is typically weak because populations are large, evolutionarily young and have a high potential for gene flow. We tested whether genetic markers influenced by natural selection are more efficient than the presumed neutral genetic markers to detect population structure in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), a migratory pelagic species with large effective population sizes. We compared the spatial and temporal patterns of divergence and statistical power of three traditional genetic marker types, microsatellites, allozymes and mitochondrial DNA, with one microsatellite locus, Cpa112, previously shown to be influenced by divergent selection associated with salinity, and one locus located in the major histocompatibility complex class IIA (MHC-IIA) gene, using the same individuals across analyses. Samples were collected in 2002 and 2003 at two locations in the North Sea, one location in the Skagerrak and one location in the low-saline Baltic Sea. Levels of divergence for putatively neutral markers were generally low, with the exception of single outlier locus/sample combinations; microsatellites were the most statistically powerful markers under neutral expectations. We found no evidence of selection acting on the MHC locus. Cpa112, however, was highly divergent in the Baltic samples. Simulations addressing the statistical power for detecting population divergence showed that when using Cpa112 alone, compared with using eight presumed neutral microsatellite loci, sample sizes could be reduced by up to a tenth while still retaining high statistical power. Our results show that the loci influenced by selection can serve as powerful markers for detecting population structure in high gene-flow marine fish species.},

abstract = {As populations diverge, genomic regions associated with adaptation display elevated differentiation. These genomic islands of adaptive divergence can inform conservation efforts in exploited species, by refining the delineation of management units, and providing genomic tools for more precise and effective population monitoring and the successful assignment of individuals and products. We explored heterogeneity in genomic divergence and its impact on the resolution of spatial population structure in exploited populations of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, using genome wide expressed sequence derived single nucleotide polymorphisms in 466 individuals sampled across the range. Outlier tests identified elevated divergence at 5.2{\%} of SNPs, consistent with directional selection in one-third of linkage groups. Genomic regions of elevated divergence ranged in size from a single position to several cM. Structuring at neutral loci was associated with geographic features, whereas outlier SNPs revealed genetic discontinuities in both the eastern and western Atlantic. This fine-scale geographic differentiation enhanced assignment to region of origin, and through the identification of adaptive diversity, fundamentally changes how these populations should be conserved. This work demonstrates the utility of genome scans for adaptive divergence in the delineation of stock structure, the traceability of individuals and products, and ultimately a role for population genomics in fisheries conservation.},

Molecular markers are useful tools as indirect estimators of these characteristics. In this study, we assess the population genetic structure of the orange coral Astroides calycularis in the Alboran Sea at local and regional scale, and at three localities outside of this basin. Bayesian clustering methods, traditional F-statistics and D(est) statistics were used to determine the patterns of genetic structure. Likelihood and coalescence approaches were used to infer migration patterns and effective population sizes. The results obtained reveal a high level of connectivity among localities separated by as much as 1 km and moderate levels of genetic differentiation among more distant localities, somewhat corresponding with a stepping-stone model of gene flow and connectivity. These data suggest that connectivity among populations of this coral is mainly driven by the biology of the species, with low dispersal abilities; in addition, hydrodynamic processes, oceanographic fronts and the distribution of rocky substrate along the coastline may influence larval dispersal.},

An understanding of red coral population structure, particularly larval dispersal patterns and connectivity among harvested populations is paramount to the viability of the species. In order to determine patterns of genetic spatial structuring of deep water Corallium rubrum populations, for the first time, colonies found between 58-118 m depth within the Tyrrhenian Sea were collected and analyzed. Ten microsatellite loci and two regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtMSH and mtC) were used to quantify patterns of genetic diversity within populations and to define population structuring at spatial scales from tens of metres to hundreds of kilometres. Microsatellites showed heterozygote deficiencies in all populations. Significant levels of genetic differentiation were observed at all investigated spatial scales, suggesting that populations are likely to be isolated. This differentiation may by the results of biological interactions, occurring within a small spatial scale and/or abiotic factors acting at a larger scale. Mitochondrial markers revealed significant genetic structuring at spatial scales greater then 100 km showing the occurrence of a barrier to gene flow between northern and southern Tyrrhenian populations. These findings provide support for the establishment of marine protected areas in the deep sea and off-shore reefs, in order to effectively maintain genetic diversity of mesophotic red coral populations.},

abstract = {In the past decades, anthropogenic disturbance has increased in marine costal habitats, leading to dramatic shifts in population size structure of various marine species. In the temperate region, the gorgonian coral (Corallium rubrum) is one of the major disturbed species, mostly owing to the exploitation of its red skeleton for jewellery purposes. Red coral is a gonocoric species inhabiting subtidal rocky habitats in the Mediterranean and neighbouring Atlantic coasts. In order to investigate the spatial genetic structuring of C. rubrum, five microsatellite markers and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) sequences were analysed in 11 samples from the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Phylogenetic reconstructions obtained from ITS-1 sequences analysis showed that samples from Minorca and Sardinia islands were the most divergent while the three samples from the Tuscan archipelago (Argentario, Giannutri and Elba) appeared genetically homogeneous. Both markers revealed a strong structuring over large spatial scales (though to a different extent) with no isolation by distance pattern. Microsatellite-based F(ST) estimates appeared much smaller than ITS-based estimates and not significantly correlated, likely due to microsatellite allele size homoplasy typical of these highly polymorphic loci. Our study shows that the absence of clear patterns of genetic structuring over large spatial scales together with strong genetic structuring should be interpreted with caution because such patterns may hide underlying small-scale genetic structuring. Our results further confirm that effective larval dispersal in red coral is highly restricted in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that an increase of anthropogenic disturbance could aggravate the disappearance of red coral, not only along the Mediterranean coasts but also, and with more intensity, in the main Mediterranean islands.},

abstract = {Biogenic reefs created by Modiolus modiolus (Linnaeus, 1758) (horse mussel reefs) are marine habitats which support high levels of species biodiversity and provide valuable eco-system services. Currently, M. modiolus reefs are listed as a threatened and/or declining species and habitat in all OSPAR regions and thus are highlighted as a conservation priority under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Determining patterns of larval dispersal and genetic connectivity of remaining horse mussel populations can inform man-agement efforts and is a critical component of effective marine spatial planning (MSP). Lar-val dispersal patterns and genetic structure were determined for several M. modiolus bed populations in the Irish Sea including those in Wales (North Pen LlÅ·n), Isle of Man (Point of Ayre) and Northern Ireland (Ards Peninsula and Strangford Lough). Simulations of larval dispersal suggested extant connectivity between populations within the Irish Sea. Results from the genetic analysis carried out using newly developed microsatellite DNA markers were consistent with those of the biophysical model. Results indicated moderately signifi-cant differentiation between the Northern Ireland populations and those in the Isle of Man and Wales. Simulations of larval dispersal over a 30 day pelagic larval duration (PLD) sug-gest that connectivity over a spatial scale of 150km is possible between some source and sink populations. However, it appears unlikely that larvae from Northern Ireland will connect directly with sites on the LlÅ·n or Isle of Man. It also appears unlikely that larvae from the LlÅ·n connect directly to any of the other sites. Taken together the data establishes a baseline for underpinning management and conservation of these important and threatened marine habitats in the southern part of the known range.},

abstract = {A precise inference of past demographic histories including dating of demographic events using bayesian methods can only be achieved with the use of appropriate molecular rates and evolutionary models. Using a set of 596 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences of two sister species of European green crabs of the genus Carcinus (C. maenas and C. aestuarii), our study shows how chronologies of past evolutionary events change significantly with the application of revised molecular rates that incorporate biogeographic events for calibration and appropriate demographic priors. A clear signal of demographic expansion was found for both species, dated between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, which places the expansions events in a time frame following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). In the case of C. aestuarii, a population expansion was only inferred for the Adriatic-Ionian, suggestive of a colonization event following the flooding of the Adriatic Sea (18,000 years ago). For C. maenas, the demographic expansion inferred for the continental populations of West and North Europe might result from a northward recolonization from a southern refugium when the ice sheet retreated after the LGM. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of using adequate calibrations and demographic priors in order to avoid considerable overestimates of evolutionary time scales.},

abstract = {Many coalescent-based methods aiming to infer the demographic history of populations assume a single, isolated and panmictic population (i.e. a Wright-Fisher model). While this assumption may be reasonable under many conditions, several recent studies have shown that the results can be misleading when it is violated. Among the most widely applied demographic inference methods are Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs), which are used across a range of biological fields. Violations of the panmixia assumption are to be expected in many biological systems, but the consequences for skyline plot inferences have so far not been addressed and quantified. We simulated DNA sequence data under a variety of scenarios involving structured populations with variable levels of gene flow and analysed them using BSPs as implemented in the software package BEAST. Results revealed that BSPs can show false signals of population decline under biologically plausible combinations of population structure and sampling strategy, suggesting that the interpretation of several previous studies may need to be re-evaluated. We found that a balanced sampling strategy whereby samples are distributed on several populations provides the best scheme for inferring demographic change over a typical time scale. Analyses of data from a structured African buffalo population demonstrate how BSP results can be strengthened by simulations. We recommend that sample selection should be carefully considered in relation to population structure previous to BSP analyses, and that alternative scenarios should be evaluated when interpreting signals of population size change.},

abstract = {This article considers the utility of DNA barcodes for conservation. DNA barcoding is a molecular tool that uses standardised genetic primers, traditionally the 600- to 800-segments of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I, to classify species. It has become increasingly popular as an efficient way of studying and categorising species to prioritise conservation efforts. A challenge remains, however, in using this information to provide a universally acceptable species concept. Genetic barcoding may focus conservation strategies on populations that have differences in mitochondrial DNA rather than on species. DNA barcodes might also provide potentially useful information about taxa that are relatively well studied-rather than those that require more research. The argument is made that DNA barcoding can provide useful taxonomic data, but should be used with caution to prevent it from being used out of context. DNA barcoding is an increasingly fashionable and novel concept that has generated optimism in enhancing biodiversity assessments-however, this approach should be used in conjunction with other methods for effective conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Aim Phylogeographical breaks may reflect historical or present-day impediments to gene flow, and the congruence of these breaks across multiple species lends insight into evolutionary history and connectivity among populations. In marine systems, examining the concordance of phylogeographical breaks is challenging due to the varied sampling scales in population genetics studies and the diverse life histories of marine organisms. A quantitative approach that considers the effects of sampling scale and species life history is needed. Location The south-east and south-west coasts of the United States. Methods We quantitatively analysed previously published datasets of marine fauna to look for concordance among phylogeographical breaks. We used a bootstrap approach to determine the regions where phylogeographical breaks are more common than expected by chance among species with planktonic dispersal as well as those with restricted dispersal. Results On the south-west coast, breaks were clustered near Point Conception among planktonic dispersers and near Los Angeles among restricted dispersers. On the south-east coast, breaks were most common near the southern tip of Florida for planktonic dispersers and near Cape Canaveral for restricted dispersers. Main conclusions Dispersal ability is an important determinant of phylogeographical patterns in marine species. Breaks among planktonic dispersers on both coasts are congruent with present-day flow-mediated barriers to dispersal, suggesting that phylogeographical structure in species with planktonic larvae may reflect contemporary oceanography, while breaks in restricted dispersers reflect historical processes. These results highlight the importance of explicitly considering sampling scale and life history when evaluating phylogeographical patterns.},

We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coral reefs in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) are amongst the most peripheral and geographically isolated in the world. This isolation has shaped the biology of TEP organisms and lead to the formation of numerous endemic species. For example, the coral Pocillopora damicornis is a minor reef-builder elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific, but is the dominant reef-building coral in the TEP, where it forms large, mono-specific stands, covering many hectares of reef. Moreover, TEP P. damicornis reproduces by broadcast spawning, while it broods mostly parthenogenetic larvae throughout the rest of the Indo-West Pacific. Population genetic surveys for P. damicornis from across its Indo-Pacific range indicate that gene flow (i.e. larval dispersal) is generally limited over hundreds of kilometers or less. Little is known about the population genetic structure and the dispersal potential of P. damicornis in the TEP. METHODOLOGY: Using multilocus microsatellite data, we analyzed the population structure of TEP P. damicornis among and within nine reefs and test for significant genetic structure across three geographically and ecologically distinct regions in Panama. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: We detected significant levels of population genetic structure (global R(ST) = 0.162), indicating restricted gene flow (i.e. larvae dispersal), both among the three regions (R(RT) = 0.081) as well as within regions (R(SR) = 0.089). Limited gene flow across a distinct environmental cline, like the regional upwelling gradient in Panama, indicates a significant potential for differential adaptation and population differentiation. Individual reefs were characterized by unexpectedly high genet diversity (avg. 94{\%}), relatively high inbreeding coefficients (global F(IS) = 0.183), and localized spatial genetic structure among individuals (i.e. unique genets) over 10 m intervals. These findings suggest that gene flow is limited in TEP P. damicornis populations, particularly among regions, but even over meter scales within populations.},

The goal of this article is to for- malize the definition of meta-analysis for the authors, editors, reviewers and readers of Molecular Ecology by completing a review of the meta-analyses previously pub- lished in this journal. We also provide a brief overview of the many components required for meta-analysis with a more specific discussion of the issues related to the field of molecular ecology, including the use and statisti- cal considerations of Wright's FST and its related ana- logues as effect sizes in meta-analysis. We performed a literature review to identify articles published as âmeta- analyses' in Molecular Ecology, which were then evalu- ated by at least two reviewers. We specifically targeted Molecular Ecology publications because as a flagship journal in this field, meta-analyses published in Molecu- lar Ecology have the potential to set the standard for meta-analyses in other journals. We found that while many of these reviewed articles were strong meta-analy- ses, others failed to follow standard meta-analytical tech- niques.

abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

Existing applications are difficult to use, leaving many non-trivial, error-prone tasks to the user. RESULTS: Here we present LOSITAN, a selection detection workbench based on a well evaluated Fst-outlier detection method. LOSITAN greatly facilitates correct approximation of model parameters (e.g., genome-wide average, neutral Fst), provides data import and export functions, iterative contour smoothing and generation of graphics in a easy to use graphical user interface. LOSITAN is able to use modern multi-core processor architectures by locally parallelizing fdist, reducing computation time by half in current dual core machines and with almost linear performance gains in machines with more cores. CONCLUSION: LOSITAN makes selection detection feasible to a much wider range of users, even for large population genomic datasets, by both providing an easy to use interface and essential functionality to complete the whole selection detection process.},

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software STRUCTURE allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (K) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated 'log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic DeltaK based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. As might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (AFLP vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.},

abstract = {An ex-Royal Navy frigate, HMS 'Scylla', was placed on the seabed in Whitsand Bay, south Cornwall on 27 March 2004. After Jive years, the reef supported a mature steel wreck community. The colonization of the reef showed wide fluctuations in species abundance in the first two years but, by 2006, most species that dominated or characterized the reef after five years had settled. Significant colonization events included settlement of barnacles, tubeworms and hydroids within a month and remarkably high settlements of the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris and the queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis in the first year together with starfish Asterias rubens, solitary sea squirts and ephemeral algae. The plumose anemone Metridium senile, a characteristic species of wrecks, arrived in late summer 2004 but the widely distributed dead man's fingers Alcyonium digitatum was not observed until spring 2005. Wrasse were slow to colonize the reef but were established in small numbers by the end of 2007. Sea fans, Eunicella verrucosa, were first observed in August 2007. The species count for the reef stood at 263 taxa by the end of March 2009. The inside of the reef remained poorly colonized even after five years. Areas coated with tributyltin (TBT) antifouling paint only had colonization where the paint had,flaked-off or on non-toxic paint markings, but with some indication that colonization may be occurring by a very few species especially near to non-TBT areas. Many species characteristic of natural reefs had not settled and neither do they occur on older wrecks including branching axinellid sponges, some cushion sponges and the yellow cluster anemone Parazoanthus axinellae. The artificial reef developed a community that was distinctly different to nearby natural rock reefs and such artificial structures should not be considered as a replacement for damaged or destroyed natural habitats.},

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

We propose a conceptual framework for including the likely impacts of a changing climate on marine connectivity, and synthesize information on the relationships between changing ocean temperature and acidification, connectivity and conservation tools. Our framework relies on concepts of functional connectivity, which depends on an organism's biological and behavioral responses to the physical environment, and structural connectivity, which describes changes in the physical and spatial structure of the environment that affect connectivity and movement. Our review confirms that ocean climate change likely reduces potential dispersal distance and therefore functional connectivity. Structural connectivity in the ocean will inevitably change with the spatial arrangement of biogenic habitats resulting from disturbance as well as enhanced growth and mortality due to climate change. Climate change will also likely reduce the spatial scale of connectivity, suggesting that we will need more closely spaced protected areas.},

Both species showed a limited genetic structure and some evidence of a demographic expansion that probably occurred not at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, but earlier in the Pleistocene. The main discrepancy between the two anglerfishes concerned the genetic structure between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, with weak but significant differentiation observed only in L. budegassa. This genetic structure was congruent with the existence of a phylogeographical break previously reported in several marine species across the Almeria-Oran front. The contrast observed between both anglerfishes was supposed to be induced by a possible more ancient (re)colonisation of the Mediterranean Sea by L. budegassa. Finally, the limited genetic structure and lack of isolation by distance observed in both species suggested high larval dispersal capacities that probably overwhelm the influence of the bathymetric distribution range on migrations of adults and juveniles. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Scallop dredging is considered to be one of the most destructive bottom fisheries, yet empirical field evidence to support this assertion, in particular for highly structured habitats, is limited. With this study, we investigated the effects of scallop dredging on the fauna of a temperate stony reef through a comparison of areas subject to different levels of fishing activity. Significant negative effects of scallop dredging were evident for 3 of the 9 species analyzed from video samples. Sessile emergent epifaunal species had significantly lower occurrences and abundances at fished sites compared to unfished sites, while commercial target species such as scallops and crabs were not significantly affected by fishing. Contrary to expectation, the pink sea fan Eunicella verrucosa, a species of local conservation concern, did not show a significant negative response with respect to abundance and average body size to the intensity of scallop dredging it had been subjected to. The absence of a clearly detectable fishing effect on this species may be related to its association with the topographically more complex areas of the reef in which the fishing efficiency of scallop dredges will be reduced. The evidence presented here demonstrates that not all species were equally affected by scallop dredging and that the complexity of stony reef habitats may provide some measure of protection at low fishing intensities},

abstract = {Design and decision-making for marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs require prediction of MPA effects with population models. Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geochemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced settlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.},

abstract = {The Strait of Gibraltar has been proposed to be the divide between two marine biogeographical regions, the Mediterranean Sea and the Northeast Atlantic. Intraspecific studies have shown, for several of the examined species, a reduction of gene flow between the two basins. The present study examines genetic variation at nuclear and mitochondrial loci in five marine teleost species belonging to the family Sparidae. Four samples for each species were analysed spanning the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean. For all individuals 17 allozyme loci were scored and a combined single strand conformation polymorphism-sequencing approach was used to survey approximately 190 bp of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region. All five species share similar biological features. For three species, namely Lithognathus mormyrus, Spondyliosoma cantharus, and Dentex dentex, large mtDNA divergence was observed between Atlantic and Mediterranean samples. Little or no mtDNA differentiation was found in the other two species, Pagrus pagrus and Pagellus bogaraveo. Allozyme data revealed strong differentiation when comparing Atlantic and Mediterranean samples of L. mormyrus and D. dentex, moderate for P. pagrus, and no differentiation for P. bogaraveo and S. cantharus. These results provide evidence for a sharp phylogeographical break (sensu Avise) between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean for two (or possibly three) sparid species of the five investigated. At the same time, the obtained results for the other two species raise the question on which ecological/historical factors might have caused the observed discrepancy in the geographical distribution of genetic variation among otherwise biologically similar species.},

Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago, at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the world's nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth's ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper.},

abstract = {Sparids are a group of demersal perciform fish of high commercial value, which have experienced an extensive radiation, particularly in the Mediterranean, where they occupy a variety of different niches. The present study focuses on two species: Diplodus sargus and D. puntazzo, presenting a wide distribution from the Mediterranean to the eastern Atlantic coasts. They display similar ecological behaviour and are evolutionary closely related. Both are highly appreciated in fisheries and D. puntazzo is currently under domestication process. However, little is know on their population structure and it is an open question whether any genetic differentiation exists at the geographic level. To address this issue we examined sequence variation of a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region in population samples of each of the two species collected over a wide geographic range. In addition to the mtDNA, analysis of nuclear loci (allozymes) was included in the study to compare patterns revealed by nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The studied samples covered an area from the eastern Mediterranean to the Portuguese coasts immediately outside the Gibraltar Strait. The two species revealed a level of sequence polymorphism remarkably different for the control region with the D. puntazzo and D. sargus showing 111 and 28 haplotypes, respectively. Such a difference was not detected with allozyme markers. The two species also showed large differences in their population structure. While D. puntazzo presented a marked genetic divergence between the Atlantic and Mediterranean samples, D. sargus showed little intraspecific differentiation. These results were supported using both mtDNA and allozyme markers, and were interpreted as the consequence of differences in the history of the two species such as fluctuations in the effective population size due to bottlenecks and expansions, possibly combined with present-day differences in levels of gene flow. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {High-throughput DNA sequencing has the potential to accelerate species discovery if it is able to recognize evolutionary entities from sequence data that are comparable to species. The general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model estimates the species boundary from DNA surveys by identifying independently evolving lineages as a transition from coalescent to speciation branching patterns on a phylogenetic tree. Applied here to 12 families from 4 orders of insects in Madagascar, we used the model to delineate 370 putative species from mitochondrial DNA sequence variation among 1614 individuals. These were compared with data from the nuclear genome and morphological identification and found to be highly congruent (98{\%} and 94{\%}). We developed a modified GMYC that allows for a variable transition from coalescent to speciation among lineages. This revised model increased the congruence with morphology (97{\%}), suggesting that a variable threshold better reflects the clustering of sequence data into biological species. Local endemism was pronounced in all 5 insect groups. Most species (60-91{\%}) and haplotypes (88-99{\%}) were found at only 1 of the 5 study sites (40-1000 km apart). This pronounced endemism resulted in a 37{\%} increase in species numbers using diagnostic nucleotides in a population aggregation analysis. Sample sizes between 7 and 10 individuals represented a threshold above which there was minimal increase in genetic diversity, broadly agreeing with coalescent theory and other empirical studies. Our results from {\textgreater} 1.4 Mb of empirical data suggest that the GMYC model captures species boundaries comparable to those from traditional methods without the need for prior hypotheses of population coherence. This provides a method of species discovery and biodiversity assessment using single-locus data from mixed or environmental samples while building a globally available taxonomic database for future identifications.},

Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (i) optimize de novo assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and maximizing the retrieval of informative loci; and (ii) quantify error rates for loci, alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As an empirical example, we use a double-digest RAD data set of a nonmodel plant species, Berberis alpina, collected from high-altitude mountains in Mexico.},

abstract = {The Pleistocene glaciations were the most significant historical event during the evolutionary life span of most extant species. However, little is known about the consequences of these climate changes for the distribution and demography of marine animals of the north-eastern Atlantic. The present study focuses on the phylogeographic and demographic patterns of the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus (Teleostei: Gobiidae), a small marine demersal fish. North-eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean, Irish, North and Baltic seas. Analysis was carried out by sequencing the mtDNA cytochrome b gene of sand gobies from 12 localities throughout the species' range, and using this information in combination with published data of allozyme markers and mtDNA control region sequences. Several phylogenetic methods and a network analysis were used to explore the phylogeographic pattern. The historical demography of P. minutus was studied through a mismatch analysis and a Bayesian skyline plot. Reciprocal monophyly was found between a Mediterranean Sea (MS) clade and an Atlantic Ocean (AO) clade, both with a Middle Pleistocene origin. The AO Clade contains two evolutionary significant units (ESUs): the Iberian Peninsula (IB) Group and the North Atlantic (NA) Group. These two groups diverged during Middle Pleistocene glacial cycles. For the NA Group there is evidence for geographic sorting of the ancestral haplotypes with recent radiations in the Baltic Sea, Irish Sea, North Sea and Bay of Biscay. The demographic histories of the Mediterranean Clade and the two Atlantic ESUs were influenced mainly by expansions dated as occurring during the Middle Pleistocene glaciations and post-Eem, respectively. The pre-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) subdivision signals were not erased for P. minutus during the LGM. Middle Pleistocene glaciations yielded isolated and differently evolving sets of populations. In contrast to the case for most other taxa, only the northern Atlantic group contributed to the post-glacial recolonization. The historical demography of Mediterranean sand gobies was influenced mainly by Middle Pleistocene glaciations, in contrast to that of the Atlantic populations, which was shaped by Late Pleistocene expansions.},

abstract = {Motivation: Restriction-siteâassociated genomic markers are a powerful tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the population level, but are limited in their utility at deeper phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically recovered across disparate taxa. While this limitation stems in part from mutations to restriction recognition sites that disrupt data generation, an additional source of data loss comes from the failure to identify homology during bioinformatic analyses. Clustering methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at assembling RADseq loci at the phylogenetic scale.$\backslash$nResults: PyRAD is a pipeline to assemble de novo RADseq loci with the aim of optimizing coverage across phylogenetic datasets. It uses a wrapper around an alignment-clustering algorithm, which allows for indel variation within and between samples, as well as for incomplete overlap among reads (e.g. paired-end). Here I compare PyRAD with the program Stacks in their performance analyzing a simulated RADseq dataset that includes indel variation. Indels disrupt clustering of homologous loci in Stacks but not in PyRAD, such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate taxa. I show through reanalysis of an empirical RADseq dataset that indels are a common feature of such data, even at shallow phylogenetic scales. PyRAD uses parallel processing as well as an optional hierarchical clustering method, which allows it to rapidly assemble phylogenetic datasets with hundreds of sampled individuals.$\backslash$nAvailability: Software is written in Python and freely available at http://www.dereneaton.com/software/$\backslash$nContact: daeaton.chicago@gmail.com$\backslash$nSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {FST, F? ST, $\Phi$ST, $\Phi$? ST, and Dest are the primary metrics utilized for empirically estimating and test- ing the magnitude of genetic divergence among populations. There is currently active discussion in the literature about which of these metrics are most appropriate for empirical surveys of genetic differentiation. Here we compare the performance of each metric in 80 simulated population com- parisons with an a priori known level of genetic differentiation that ranges from 0 to 100{\%}. In these simulations, we manipulate population characteristics such as the genetic distance between haplotypes and the diversity of haplotypes that are shared among populations, as well as those that are unique to specific populations, illustrating key features and differences among the metrics, with an eye toward separating biological signal from statistical noise. FST is the best choice for datasets consisting of neutral unlinked single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets involving two alleles per locus. Dest and F? ST tend to be the best metrics for analyses with more than two alleles, at least where the genetic distance among the alleles is not important, but the use of F? ST and, to a greater extent, Dest is currently limited to relatively simple datasets, due to a dearth of computer software. If genetic distance among alleles is an important consideration, then $\Phi$ST is the better metric, but we demonstrate that $\Phi$ST and $\Phi$? ST can accentuate either noise or signal, depending upon the charac- teristics of the populations and the hypotheses being tested. In many cases, it can be informative to apply both distance-based and allele/haplotype-based metrics, or both fixation and genetic differen- tiation indices. All of these measures are highly sensitive to the diversity of alleles shared between populations, with common alleles dominating the behavior of all of these metrics. $\Phi$ST is shown to be relatively unaffected by the phenomenon of high allelic diversity driving down estimates of genetic differentiation that plague FST. Overall, there is no single metric that best captures popula- tion genetic differentiation, and we recommend that researchers report both a fixation index (FST or $\Phi$ST) and an index of genetic differentiation (F? ST or Dest) for their datasets because they represent different properties of population partitioning. When indices of fixation and genetic differentiation are in agreement, one can be sure of the conclusion. When the two methods yield differing results, the pattern and direction of discord can be diagnostic of a particular phenomenon, and we provide a range of simulations across parameter space to illustrate both points.},

Community-scale inference methods that explicitly test for multiple vicariance events, and account for differences in ancestral effective population size and gene flow, are well suited for detecting heterogeneity of species' responses to past climate fluctuations. We apply this approach to multi-locus sequence data from five co-distributed frog species endemic to the Wet Tropics rainforests of northeast Australia. Our results demonstrate at least two episodes of vicariance owing to climate-driven forest contractions: one in the Early Pleistocene and the other considerably older. Understanding how repeated cycles of rainforest contraction and expansion differentially affected lineage divergence among co-distributed species provides a framework for identifying evolutionary processes that underlie population divergence and speciation.},

abstract = {The historic processes which have led to the present-day patterns of genetic structure in the marine coastal fauna of the Northeast Atlantic are still poorly understood. While tectonic uplifts and changes in sea level may have caused large-scale vicariance, warmer conditions during glacial maxima may have allowed pockets of diversity to persist to a much wider extent than in the Northwestern Atlantic. The large-scale geographic distribution of deeply divergent lineages of the coastal polychaete tubeworms Pectinaria koreni (two clades) and Owenia fusiformis (three clades) were compared using a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (mtCOI). All lineages were present along the biogeographic transition zone on the north coast of Brittany (France) and we found evidence pointing towards congruence in the timing of cladogenic events between Pectinaria sp. (P. auricoma/P. belgica and P. koreni) and Owenia sp., suggesting a shared history of vicariant events. More conserved 16SrRNA sequences obtained from four species of Pectinariidae together with mtCOI sequences of P. koreni seem consistent with an initial establishment of pectinariids in the north, and a southward colonization of the Northeast Atlantic. Phylogeographic patterns in O. fusiformis were also consistent with a north/south pattern of lineage splitting and congruent levels of divergence were detected between lineages of both species. We observed signatures of both persistence in small northern glacial refugia, and of northwards range expansion from regions situated closer to the Mediterranean. However, whether the recolonization of the Northeast Atlantic by both species actually reflects separate interglacial periods is unclear with regards to the lack of molecular clock calibration in coastal polychaete species.},

abstract = {Connectivity is widely recognized as an important component in developing effective management and conservation strategies. Although managers are generally most interested in demographic, rather than genetic connectivity, new analytic approaches are able to provide estimates of both demographic and genetic connectivity measures from genetic data. Combining such genetic data with mathematical models represents a powerful approach for accurately determining patterns of population connectivity. Here, we use microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic population structure of the New Zealand Rock Lobster, Jasus edwardsii, which has one of the longest known larval durations of all marine species ({\textgreater}2 years), a very large geographic range ({\textgreater}5500âkm), and has been the subject of extensive dispersal modeling. Despite earlier mitochondrial DNA studies finding homogeneous genetic structure, the mathematical model suggests that there are source-sink dynamics for this species. We found evidence of genetic structure in J. edwardsii populations with three distinct genetic groups across New Zealand and a further Australian group; these groups and patterns of gene flow were generally congruent with the earlier mathematical model. Of particular interest was the consistent identification of a self-recruiting population/region from both modeling and genetic approaches. Although there is the potential for selection and harvesting to influence the patterns we observed, we believe oceanographic processes are most likely responsible for the genetic structure observed in J. edwardsii. Our results, using a species at the extreme end of the dispersal spectrum, demonstrate that source-sink population dynamics may still exist for such species.},

abstract = {Genetic data are often used to assess 'population connectivity' because it is difficult to measure dispersal directly at large spatial scales. Genetic connectivity, however, depends primarily on the absolute number of dispersers among populations, whereas demographic connectivity depends on the relative contributions to population growth rates of dispersal vs. local recruitment (i.e. survival and reproduction of residents). Although many questions are best answered with data on genetic connectivity, genetic data alone provide little information on demographic connectivity. The importance of demographic connectivity is clear when the elimination of immigration results in a shift from stable or positive population growth to negative population growth. Otherwise, the amount of dispersal required for demographic connectivity depends on the context (e.g. conservation or harvest management), and even high dispersal rates may not indicate demographic interdependence. Therefore, it is risky to infer the importance of demographic connectivity without information on local demographic rates and how those rates vary over time. Genetic methods can provide insight on demographic connectivity when combined with these local demographic rates, data on movement behaviour, or estimates of reproductive success of immigrants and residents. We also consider the strengths and limitations of genetic measures of connectivity and discuss three concepts of genetic connectivity that depend upon the evolutionary criteria of interest: inbreeding connectivity, drift connectivity, and adaptive connectivity. To conclude, we describe alternative approaches for assessing population connectivity, highlighting the value of combining genetic data with capture-mark-recapture methods or other direct measures of movement to elucidate the complex role of dispersal in natural populations.},

Networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are an important tool for ensuring long-term health and conservation of ecological processes in the marine environment. Design of the MPA network has to be based on deep understanding of spatial patterns of species distribution, and on the make-up of connectivity among populations. Most benthic invertebrates are sessile and/or sedentary in the adult phase, and their dispersal relies mainly on the gametes and/or larval behaviours. Genetic markers allow us to quantify gene flow and structuring among populations, and to infer patterns of genetic connectivity. Based on the information available in the peer reviewed literature on genetic connectivity in benthic invertebrates of temperate MPAs, we provide a comment about the gaps and the needs. Moreover, we propose a rationale to plan and optimise future studies on this topic. A conceptual framework for planning effective studies on genetic connectivity in an MPAs network is provided, including general recommendations on sampling design, key species and molecular markers to use.},

abstract = {Approximately 20,000 years ago the last glacial maximum (LGM) radically altered the distributions of many Northern Hemisphere terrestrial organisms. Fewer studies describing the biogeographic responses of marine species to the LGM have been conducted, but existing genetic data from coastal marine species indicate that fewer taxa show clear signatures of post-LGM recolonization. We have assembled a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data set for 14 co-distributed northeastern Pacific rocky-shore species from four phyla by combining new sequences from ten species with previously published sequences from eight species. Nuclear sequences from four species were retrieved from GenBank, plus we gathered new elongation factor 1-alpha sequences from the barnacle Balanus glandula. Results from demographic analyses of mtDNA for five (36{\%}) species (Evasterias troschelii, Pisaster ochraceus, Littorina sitkana, L. scutulata, Xiphister mucosus) were consistent with large population expansions occurring near the LGM, a pattern expected if these species recently recolonized the region. However, seven (50{\%}) species (Mytilus trossulus, M. californianus, B. glandula, S. cariosus, Patiria miniata, Katharina tunicata, X. atropurpureus) exhibited histories consistent with long-term stability in effective population size, a pattern indicative of regional persistence during the LGM. Two species of Nucella with significant mtDNA genetic structure showed spatially variable demographic histories. Multilocus analyses for five species were largely consistent with mtDNA: the majority of multilocus interpopulation divergence times significantly exceeded the LGM. Our results indicate that the LGM did not extirpate the majority of species in the northeastern Pacific; instead, regional persistence during the LGM appears a common biogeographic history for rocky-shore organisms in this region.},

abstract = {Comparing many species' population genetic patterns across the same seascape can identify species with different levels of structure, and suggest hypotheses about the processes that cause such variation for species in the same ecosystem. This comparative approach helps focus on geographic barriers and selective or demographic processes that define genetic connectivity on an ecosystem scale, the understanding of which is particularly important for large-scale management efforts. Moreover, a multispecies dataset has great statistical advantages over single-species studies, lending explanatory power in an effort to uncover the mechanisms driving population structure. Here, we analyze a 50-species dataset of Pacific nearshore invertebrates with the aim of discovering the most influential structuring factors along the Pacific coast of North America. We collected cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mtDNA data from populations of 34 species of marine invertebrates sampled coarsely at four coastal locations in California, Oregon, and Alaska, and added published data from 16 additional species. All nine species with non-pelagic development have strong genetic structure. For the 41 species with pelagic development, 13 show significant genetic differentiation, nine of which show striking FST levels of 0.1-0.6. Finer scale geographic investigations show unexpected regional patterns of genetic change near Cape Mendocino in northern California for five of the six species tested. The region between Oregon and Alaska is a second focus of intraspecific genetic change, showing differentiation in half the species tested. Across regions, strong genetic subdivision occurs more often than expected in mid-to-high intertidal species, a result that may reflect reduced gene flow due to natural selection along coastal environmental gradients. Finally, the results highlight the importance of making primary research accessible to policymakers, as unexpected barriers to marine dispersal break the coast into separate demographic zones that may require their own management plans.},

Surprisingly, within the 300-km barrier region, several species considered exposed rocky shore specialists occurred within sheltered sites. We analysed COI sequence variation for 10 rocky intertidal invertebrate species, with a range of life histories, to test the hypotheses that larval type and habitat specificity are strong predictors of gene flow between biogeographic regions. Our data revealed that the southeast corner of Australia includes a strong barrier to gene flow for six of eight species with planktonic larvae, and a coalescence analysis of sequence differentiation (IM model) suggests that a barrier has existed since the Pleistocene. In contrast, two direct developers were not affected by the barrier. Our comparative approach and data from earlier studies (reviewed here) do not support the hypothesis that larval type predicts gene flow across this barrier, instead we found that the ability to utilize sheltered habitat provides a clearer explanation of the phylogeographic break. Indeed, the species that displayed little or no evidence of a phylogeographic break across the barrier each displayed unexpectedly relaxed habitat specificity.},

abstract = {Maerl is a general term used for loose-lying subtidal beds of nodular coralline red algae. Maerl beds support high associated invertebrate and algal biodiversity, and are subject to European and UK conservation legislation. Previous investigations have shown European maerl to be ecologically fragile due to growth rates of approximately 1 mm per year. However, these very slow growth rates have hampered attempts to determine the key ecological requirements and sensitivity characteristics of living maerl. In this study, photosynthetic capacity determined by pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry was used as a diagnostic of stress caused by various environmental conditions. Maerl species were exposed to a range of temperatures, salinities and light levels and to burial, fragmentation, desiccation and heavy metal treatment. Maerl was not as susceptible as previously assumed to extremes of salinity, temperature and heavy metal pollution, but burial, especially in fine or anoxic sediments, was lethal or caused significant stress. These data indicate that the main anthropogenic hazard for live maerl and the rich communities that depend on them is smothering by fine sediment, such as that produced by trawling or maerl extraction, from sewage discharges or shellfish and fish farm waste, and sedimentation resulting from disruption to tidal flow. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Commission's âHabitats Directive' mandates the conservation management of two of the main European maerl-forming species, Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides. 5. Mediterranean maerl beds are to be considered for inclusion in national inventories of sites of conservation interest, as required by the SPABIM Protocol of the Barcelona Convention. 6. In spite of their importance, and the requirement for their conservation management, European maerl grounds suffer a variety of anthropogenic perturbations including direct exploitation through extraction, fishing impacts and chemical pollution by organic matter and excess nutrients. 7. The ecology of northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean maerl beds has received little attention, in contrast to other marine communities (e.g. kelp forests, sea-grass meadows). 8. Key conservation and management measures proposed include: the recognition that maerl beds are non-renewable resources and cannot sustain direct exploitation; prohibitions on the use of towed gear on maerl grounds; moratoria on the issue of further permits for the siting of aquaculture units above maerl grounds; monitoring of existing exploited or impacted maerl beds; the designation of âno-take' reserves; measures to limit the impacts that might affect water quality above maerl beds; a programme of monitoring of the âhealth' of European maerl beds; an awareness campaign on the biological importance of maerl beds; a higher conservation status for maerl habitats and maerlforming species in European legislation; and further research on maerl ecosystems.},

abstract = {The first recorded incidence of cold-water coral disease was noted in Eunicella verrucosa, a coral on the international 'red list' of threatened species, at a marine protected area in SW England in 2002. Video surveys of 634 separate colonies at 13 sites revealed that disease outbreaks were widespread in SW England from 2003 to 2006. Coenchyme became necrotic in diseased specimens, leading to tissue sloughing and exposing skeletal gorgonin to settlement by fouling organisms. Sites where necrosis was found had significantly higher incidences of fouling. No fungi were isolated from diseased or healthy tissue, but significantly higher concentrations of bacteria occurred in diseased specimens. Of 21 distinct bacteria isolated from diseased tissues, 19 were Vibrionaceae, 15 were strains of Vibrio splendidus and 2 others closely matched Vibrio tasmaniensis. Vibrios isolated from E. verrucosa did not induce disease at 15 degrees C, but, at 20 degrees C, controls remained healthy and test gorgonians became diseased, regardless of whether vibrios were isolated from diseased or healthy colonies. Bacteria associated with diseased tissue produced proteolytic and cytolytic enzymes that damaged E. verrucosa tissue and may be responsible for the necrosis observed. Monitoring at the site where the disease was first noted showed new gorgonian recruitment from 2003 to 2006; some individuals had died and become completely overgrown, whereas others had continued to grow around a dead central area.},

abstract = {Lower Central America (LCA) provides a geologically complex and dynamic, richly biodiverse model for studying the recent assembly and diversification of a Neotropical biota. Here, we review the growing literature of LCA phylogeography studies and their contribution to understanding the origins, assembly, and diversification of the LCA biota against the backdrop of regional geologic and climatic history, and previous biogeographical inquiry. Studies to date reveal that phylogeographical signal within taxa of differing distributions reflects a diversity of patterns and processes rivalling the complexities of LCA landscapes themselves. Even so, phylogeography is providing novel insights into regional diversification (e.g. cryptic lineage divergences), and general evolutionary patterns are emerging. Congruentmulti-taxon phylogeographic breaks are found across the Nicaraguan depression, Chorotega volcanic front, western and central Panama, and the DariÂ´ en isthmus, indicating that a potentially shared history of responses to regional-scale (e.g. geological) processes has shaped the genetic diversity of LCA communities. By contrast, other species show unique demographic histories in response to overriding historical events, including no phylogeographic structure at all. These low-structure or incongruent patterns provide some evidence for a role of local, ecological factors (e.g. long-distance dispersal and gene flow in plants and bats) in shaping LCA communities. Temporally, comparative phylogeographical structuring reflects PlioceneâPleistocene dispersal and vicariance events consistent with the timeline of emergence of the LCA isthmus and its major physiographic features, e.g. cordilleras. We emphasise the need to improve biogeographic inferences in LCA through in-depth comparative phylogeography projects capitalising on the latest statistical phylogeographical methods. Whilemeeting the challenges of reconstructing the biogeographical history of this complex region, phylogeographers should also take up the critical service to society of applying their work to the conservation of its fascinating biodiversity.

abstract = {Biogeography investigates spatial patterns of species distribution. Discontinuities in species distribution are identified as boundaries between biogeographic areas. Do these boundaries affect genetic connectivity? To address this question, a multifactorial hierarchical sampling design, across three of the major marine biogeographic boundaries in the central Mediterranean Sea (Ligurian-Tyrrhenian, Tyrrhenian-Ionian and Ionian-Adriatic) was carried out. Mitochondrial COI sequence polymorphism of seven species of Mediterranean benthic invertebrates was analysed. Two species showed significant genetic structure across the Tyrrhenian-Ionian boundary, as well as two other species across the Ionian Sea, a previously unknown phylogeographic barrier. The hypothesized barrier in the Ligurian-Tyrrhenian cannot be detected in the genetic structure of the investigated species. Connectivity patterns across species at distances up to 800 km apart confirmed that estimates of pelagic larval dispersal were poor predictors of the genetic structure. The detected genetic discontinuities seem more related to the effect of past historical events, though maintained by present day oceanographic processes. Multivariate statistical tools were used to test the consistency of the patterns across species, providing a conceptual framework for across-species barrier locations and strengths. Additional sequences retrieved from public databases supported our findings. Heterogeneity of phylogeographic patterns shown by the 7 investigated species is relevant to the understanding of the genetic diversity, and carry implications for conservation biology.},

abstract = {Application of high throughput sequencing platforms in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology is developing quickly since the introduction of efficient methods to reduce genome complexity. Numerous approaches for genome complexity reduction have been developed using different combinations of restriction enzymes, library construction strategies and fragment size selection. As a result, the choice of which techniques to use may become cumbersome, because it is difficult to anticipate the number of loci resulting from each method. We develop SimRAD, an R package that performs in silico restriction enzyme digests and fragment size selection as implemented in most restriction associated DNA polymorphism and genotyping by sequencing methods. In silico digestion is performed on a reference genome or on a randomly generated DNA sequence when no reference genome sequence is available. SimRAD accurately predicts the number of loci under alternative protocols when a reference genome sequence is available for the targeted species (or a close relative) but may be unreliable when no reference genome is available. SimRAD is also useful for fine-tuning a given protocol to adjust the number of targeted loci. Here, we outline the functionality of SimRAD and provide an illustrative example of the use of the package (available on the CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SimRAD).

abstract = {The maturation of marine phylogeography depends on integration of comparative information across different regions globally. The northwestern Pacific, characterized by unique tectonic setting, however, is still underrepresented. This study seeks to highlight its phylogeographical history based on the available population data, focusing on three seas: the East China Sea (ECS), the South China Sea (SCS) and the Sea of Japan (SOJ). We first conducted a literature survey to evaluate current research efforts and then reanalysed the population structure, historical demography and genealogy for two selections of studies (namely 'the ECS category' and 'the multiple-sea category') to elucidate the evolutionary processes within and across the seas, respectively. For the ECS category, the meta-analyses revealed most studies displayed a shallow phylogeny, indicating a single origin from the sea. Significant population structure was commonplace, particularly in molluck and crustacean studies, with proportions of 89{\%} and 80{\%}, respectively. Nearly all studies selected showed signals of population expansion: the times estimated were closely linked to a period of {\~{}}120-140 Kya rather than the last glacial maximum. For the latter category, divergent intraspecific lineages appeared among seas and overlapped in the adjacent regions, a pattern implying each sea had served as an independent refugium during glaciations. The genetic splits, however, were estimated to arise from separate events dating from late Miocene to middle Pleistocene. As phylogeography is still in its infancy in the region, more effort is needed to test and complement the general rules abstracted here. Finally, challenges and prospects were discussed to accelerate further research. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

One such barrier was the Torres Strait land bridge between continental Australia and New Guinea that per- sisted through much of the late Pleistocene and separated Indian and Pacific Ocean taxa. Here, we examine the pat- terns of mitochondrial DNA diversity for marine animals with present-day distributions spanning the Torres Strait. Specifically, we investigate whether there are concordant signatures across species, consistent with either vicariance or recent colonization from either ocean basin. We survey four species of reef fishes (Apogon doederleini, Poma- centrus coelestis, Dascyllus trimaculatus, and Acanthurus triostegus) for mtDNA cytochrome oxidase 1 and control region variation and contrast these results to previous mtDNA studies in diverse marine animals with similar distributions. We find substantial genetic partitioning (estimated from F-statistics and coalescent approaches) between Indian and Pacific Ocean populations for many species, consistent with regional persistence through the late Pleistocene in both ocean basins.

abstract = {Comparative multispecies studies allow contrasting the effect of past and present oceanographic processes on phylogeographic patterns. In the present study, a fragment of the COI gene was analyzed in seven decapod crustacean species from five families and with different bathymetric distributions. A total of 769 individuals were sampled along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition area in order to test the effect of three putative barriers to gene flow: Strait of Gibraltar, Almeria-Oran Front and Ibiza Channel. A significant effect of the Strait of Gibraltar was found in the crabs Liocarcinus depurator and Macropipus tuberculatus. The Ibiza Channel had a significant effect for L. depurator. However, the Almeria-Oran front was not found to have a significant effect on any of the studied species. Higher levels of population structure were found in shallow-water species, although the number of species sampled should be increased to obtain a conclusive pattern. The haplotypes within the different species coalesced at times that could be related with past climatic events occurring before, during and after the last glacial maximum. Given the large diversity of phylogeographic patterns obtained within decapods, it is concluded that both historical and contemporary processes (marine current patterns, bathymetry and life-history traits) shape the phylogeographic patterns of these crustaceans. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Characterization of large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout a genome has the power to refine the understanding of population demographic history and to identify genomic regions under selection in natural populations. To this end, population genomic approaches that harness the power of next-generation sequencing to understand the ecology and evolution of marine invertebrates represent a boon to test long-standing questions in marine biology and conservation. We employed restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to identify SNPs in natural populations of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, an emerging cnidarian model with a broad geographic range in estuarine habitats in North and South America, and portions of England. We identified hundreds of SNP-containing tags in thousands of RAD loci from 30 barcoded individuals inhabiting four locations from Nova Scotia to South Carolina. Population genomic analyses using high-confidence SNPs resulted in a highly-resolved phylogeography, a result not achieved in previous studies using traditional markers. Plots of locus-specific FST against heterozygosity suggest that a majority of polymorphic sites are neutral, with a smaller proportion suggesting evidence for balancing selection. Loci inferred to be under balancing selection were mapped to the genome, where 90{\%} were located in gene bodies, indicating potential targets of selection. The results from analyses with and without a reference genome supported similar conclusions, further highlighting RAD-seq as a method that can be efficiently applied to species lacking existing genomic resources. We discuss the utility of RAD-seq approaches in burgeoning Nematostella research as well as in other cnidarian species, particularly corals and jellyfishes, to determine phylogeographic relationships of populations and identify regions of the genome undergoing selection.},

abstract = {The widespread assumption that COI and other mitochondrial genes will be ineffective DNA barcodes for anthozoan cnidarians has not been well tested for most anthozoans other than scleractinian corals. Here we examine the limitations of mitochondrial gene barcoding in the sub-class Octocorallia, a large, diverse, and ecologically important group of anthozoans. Pairwise genetic distance values (uncorrected p) were compared for three candidate barcoding regions: the Folmer region of COI; a fragment of the octocoral-specific mitochondrial protein-coding gene, msh1; and an extended barcode of msh1 plus COI with a short, adjacent intergenic region (igr1). Intraspecific variation was {\textless}0.5{\%}, with most species exhibiting no variation in any of the three gene regions. Interspecific divergence was also low: 18.5{\%} of congeneric morphospecies shared identical COI barcodes, and there was no discernible barcoding gap between intra- and interspecific p values. In a case study to assess regional octocoral biodiversity, COI and msh1 barcodes each identified 70{\%} of morphospecies. In a second case study, a nucleotide character-based analysis correctly identified 70{\%} of species in the temperate genus Alcyonium. Although interspecific genetic distances were 2Ã greater for msh1 than COI, each marker identified similar numbers of species in the two case studies, and the extended COI + igr1 + msh1 barcode more effectively discriminated sister taxa in Alcyonium. Although far from perfect for species identification, a COI + igr1 + msh1 barcode nonetheless represents a valuable addition to the depauperate set of characters available for octocoral taxonomy.},

abstract = {The anthozoan sub-class Octocorallia, comprising approximately 3000 species of soft corals, gorgonians, and sea pens, remains one of the most poorly understood groups of the phylum Cnidaria. Efforts to classify the soft corals and gorgonians at the suprafamilial level have long thwarted taxonomists, and the subordinal groups in current use are widely recognized to represent grades of colony forms rather than clades. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the sub-class do not support either the current morphologically based subordinal or familial-level taxonomy. To date, however, the resolution necessary to propose an alternative, phylogenetic classification of Octocorallia or to elucidate patterns of morphological evolution within the group is lacking. Attempts to understand boundaries between species and interspecific or intraspecific phylogenetic relationships have been hampered by the very slow rate of mitochondrial gene evolution in Octocorallia, and a consequent dearth of molecular markers with variation sufficient to distinguish species (or sometimes genera). A review of the available ITS2 sequence data for octocorals, however, reveals a yet-unexplored phylogenetic signal both at sequence and secondary-structure levels. In addition, incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees suggests that hybrid speciation and reticulate evolution may be an important mechanism of diversification in some genera. Emerging next-generation genomic-sequencing technologies offer the best hope for a breakthrough in our understanding of phylogenetic relationships and of evolution of morphological traits in Octocorallia. Genome and transcriptome sequencing may provide enough characters to resolve relationships at the deepest levels of the octocoral tree, while simultaneously offering an efficient means to screen for new genetic markers variable enough to distinguish species and populations.},

abstract = {RAD-tag sequencing is a promising method for conducting genome-wide evolutionary studies. However, to date, only a handful of studies empirically tested its applicability above the species level. In this communication, we use RAD tags to contribute to the delimitation of species within a diverse genus of deep-sea octocorals, Chrysogorgia, for which few classical genetic markers have proved informative. Previous studies have hypothesized that single mitochondrial haplotypes can be used to delimit Chrysogorgia species. On the basis of two lanes of Illumina sequencing, we inferred phylogenetic relationships among 12 putative species that were delimited using mitochondrial data, comparing two RAD analysis pipelines (Stacks and PyRAD). The number of homologous RAD loci decreased dramatically with increasing divergence, as {\textgreater}70{\%} of loci are lost when comparing specimens separated by two mutations on the 700-nt long mitochondrial phylogeny. Species delimitation hypotheses based on the mitochondrial mtMutS gene are largely supported, as six out of nine putative species represented by more than one colony were recovered as discrete, well-supported clades. Significant genetic structure (correlating with geography) was detected within one putative species, suggesting that individuals characterized by the same mtMutS haplotype may belong to distinct species. Conversely, three mtMutS haplotypes formed one well-supported clade within which no population structure was detected, also suggesting that intraspecific variation exists at mtMutS in Chrysogorgia. Despite an impressive decrease in the number of homologous loci across clades, RAD data helped us to fine-tune our interpretations of classical mitochondrial markers used in octocoral species delimitation, and discover previously undetected diversity.},

@article{Leray2012,
abstract = {Although benthic motile invertebrate communities encompass the vast majority of coral reef diversity, their response to habitat modification has been poorly studied. A variety of benthic species, particularly decapods, provide benefits to their coral host enabling them to cope with environmental stressors, and as a result benefit the overall diversity of coral-associated species. However, little is known about how invertebrate assemblages associated with corals will be affected by global perturbations, (either directly or indirectly via their coral host) or their consequences for ecosystem resilience. Analysis of a ten year dataset reveals that the greatest perturbation at Moorea over this time was an outbreak of the corallivorous sea star Acanthaster planci from 2006 to 2009 impacting habitat health, availability and size structure of Pocillopora spp. populations and highlights a positive relationship between coral head size and survival. We then present the results of a mensurative study in 2009 conducted at the end of the perturbation (A. planci outbreak) describing how coral-decapod communities change with percent coral mortality for a selected coral species, Pocillopora eydouxi. The loss of coral tissue as a consequence of A. planci consumption led to an increase in rarefied total species diversity, but caused drastic modifications in community composition driven by a shift from coral obligate to non-obligate decapod species. Our study highlights that larger corals left with live tissue in 2009, formed a restricted habitat where coral obligate decapods, including mutualists, could subsist. We conclude that the size structure of Pocillopora populations at the time of an A. planci outbreak may greatly condition the magnitude of coral mortality as well as the persistence of local populations of obligate decapods.},

abstract = {Outbreaks of the coral-killing seastar Acanthaster planci are intense disturbances that can decimate coral reefs. These events consist of the emergence of large swarms of the predatory seastar that feed on reef-building corals, often leading to widespread devastation of coral populations. While cyclic occurrences of such outbreaks are reported from many tropical reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific, their causes are hotly debated, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of the outbreaks and impacts to reef communities remain unclear. Based on observations of a recent event around the island of Moorea, French Polynesia, we show that Acanthaster outbreaks are methodic, slow-paced, and diffusive biological disturbances. Acanthaster outbreaks on insular reef systems like Moorea's appear to originate from restricted areas confined to the ocean-exposed base of reefs. Elevated Acanthaster densities then progressively spread to adjacent and shallower locations by migrations of seastars in aggregative waves that eventually affect the entire reef system. The directional migration across reefs appears to be a search for prey as reef portions affected by dense seastar aggregations are rapidly depleted of living corals and subsequently left behind. Coral decline on impacted reefs occurs by the sequential consumption of species in the order of Acanthaster feeding preferences. Acanthaster outbreaks thus result in predictable alteration of the coral community structure. The outbreak we report here is among the most intense and devastating ever reported. Using a hierarchical, multi-scale approach, we also show how sessile benthic communities and resident coral-feeding fish assemblages were subsequently affected by the decline of corals. By elucidating the processes involved in an Acanthaster outbreak, our study contributes to comprehending this widespread disturbance and should thus benefit targeted management actions for coral reef ecosystems.},

@article{Hickerson2010,
abstract = {Approximately 20 years ago, Avise and colleagues proposed the integration of phylogenetics and population genetics for investigating the connection between micro- and macroevolutionary phenomena. The new field was termed phylogeography. Since the naming of the field, the statistical rigor of phylogeography has increased, in large part due to concurrent advances in coalescent theory which enabled model-based parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. The next phase will involve phylogeography increasingly becoming the integrative and comparative multi-taxon endeavor that it was originally conceived to be. This exciting convergence will likely involve combining spatially-explicit multiple taxon coalescent models, genomic studies of natural selection, ecological niche modeling, studies of ecological speciation, community assembly and functional trait evolution. This ambitious synthesis will allow us to determine the causal links between geography, climate change, ecological interactions and the evolution and composition of taxa across whole communities and assemblages. Although such integration presents analytical and computational challenges that will only be intensified by the growth of genomic data in non-model taxa, the rapid development of "likelihood-free" approximate Bayesian methods should permit parameter estimation and hypotheses testing using complex evolutionary demographic models and genomic phylogeographic data. We first review the conceptual beginnings of phylogeography and its accomplishments and then illustrate how it evolved into a statistically rigorous enterprise with the concurrent rise of coalescent theory. Subsequently, we discuss ways in which model-based phylogeography can interface with various subfields to become one of the most integrative fields in all of ecology and evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {For many taxa, introgression represents an important source of genetic variation, but the specific contexts allowing locally introgressed material to spread and largely replace native allelic lineages throughout a species range remain poorly understood. Recent demographic-genetic simulations of spatial expansions show that the stochastic surfing of alien alleles during range expansions may constitute a general mechanism leading to extensive introgression, but empirical evidence remain scarce and difficult to distinguish from selection. In this study, we report a compelling case of such a phenomenon in the estuarine alga Fucus ceranoides. We re-assessed the phylogenetic relationships among F. ceranoides and its marine congeners F. vesiculosus and F. spiralis using nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast sequence data, and conducted a mtDNA phylogeographic survey in F. ceranoides. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed a recent and asymmetric introgression of a single F. vesiculosus cytoplasm into F. ceranoides. The phylogeographic scope of introgression was striking, with native and introgressed mtDNA displaying disjunct distributions south and north of the English Channel. A putative Pleistocene climatic refugium was detected in NW Iberia, and the extensive and exclusive spread of the alien cytoplasm throughout Northern Europe was inferred to have occurred concurrently with the species post-glacial, northwards range expansion. This massive spread of a foreign organelle throughout the entire post-glacial recolonization range represents good empirical evidence of an alien cytoplasm surfing the wave of a range expansion and the first description of such a phenomenon in the marine realm.},

abstract = {Marine fish seem to experience evolutionary processes that are expected to produce genetically homogeneous populations. We have assessed genetic diversity and differentiation in 15 samples of the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas, 1770) (Gobiidae, Teleostei) from four major habitats within the Southern Bight of the North Sea, using seven microsatellite and 13 allozyme loci. Despite its high dispersal potential, microsatellite loci revealed a moderate level of differentiation (overall F(ST)=0.026; overall R(ST)=0.058). Both hierarchical analysis of molecular variance and multivariate analysis revealed significant differentiation (P{\textless}0.01) between estuarine, coastal and marine samples with microsatellites, but not with allozymes. Comparison among the different estimators of differentiation (F(ST) and R(ST)) pointed to possible historical events and contemporary habitat fragmentation. Samples were assigned to two breeding units in the estuary and coastal region. Despite this classification, there were indications of a complex and dynamic spatiotemporal structure, which is, most likely, determined by historical events and local oceanic currents.},

abstract = {Analysis of the genetic structure of the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), a marine crustacean with high commercial value, was undertaken to gain information regarding the differentiation of Atlantic from Mediterranean populations of marine invertebrates. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of two mitochondrial DNA segments, 3.6 kilobases in total, was performed. Twelve populations from the North Sea, Irish Sea, Portuguese coast and Aegean Sea were analysed. Low levels of differentiation were found among them (F(ST) = 0.018, P {\textless} 0.001) and there were no signs of an Atlantic-Mediterranean divide or of an isolation-by-distance scheme of differentiation. Possible reasons for these low levels of differentiation can be found in the recent expansion of N. norvegicus populations. This is supported by the mismatch distribution of pairwise haplotype differences, as well as by the high mean haplotype diversity (h = 0.93) combined with medium nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0057) (in comparison to values for marine crustaceans or teleosts) found in this study. This combination of high levels of haplotype diversity with moderate to low levels of nucleotide diversity has also been frequently attributed to a recent time of divergence for various marine species. No evidence was found for a Mediterranean refugium during glaciation periods, separate from the Atlantic, as has been reported for some marine species. The Irish Sea population was the most differentiated as a result of reduced levels of diversity. Results are also discussed in the light of future management of N. norvegicus stocks.},

abstract = {As the most widespread seagrass in temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, Zostera marina provides a unique opportunity to investigate the extent to which the historical legacy of the last glacial maximum (LGM18 000-10 000 years bp) is detectable in modern population genetic structure. We used sequences from the nuclear rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast matK-intron, and nine microsatellite loci to survey 49 populations ({\textgreater} 2000 individuals) from throughout the species' range. Minimal sequence variation between Pacific and Atlantic populations combined with biogeographical groupings derived from the microsatellite data, suggest that the trans-Arctic connection is currently open. The east Pacific and west Atlantic are more connected than either is to the east Atlantic. Allelic richness was almost two-fold higher in the Pacific. Populations from putative Atlantic refugia now represent the southern edges of the distribution and are not genetically diverse. Unexpectedly, the highest allelic diversity was observed in the North Sea-Wadden Sea-southwest Baltic region. Except for the Mediterranean and Black Seas, significant isolation-by-distance was found from {\~{}}150 to 5000 km. A transition from weak to strong isolation-by-distance occurred at {\~{}}150 km among northern European populations suggesting this scale as the natural limit for dispersal within the metapopulation. Links between historical and contemporary processes are discussed in terms of the projected effects of climate change on coastal marine plants. The identification of a high genetic diversity hotspot in Northern Europe provides a basis for restoration decisions.},

abstract = {Phylogeography has provided a new approach to the analysis of the postglacial history of a wide range of taxa but, to date, little is known about the effect of glacial periods on the marine biota of Europe. We have utilized a combination of nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial genetic markers to study the biogeographic history of the red seaweed Palmaria palmata in the North Atlantic. Analysis of the nuclear rDNA operon (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), the plastid 16S-trnI-trnA-23S-5S, rbcL-rbcS and rpl12-rps31-rpl9 regions and the mitochondrial cox2-3 spacer has revealed the existence of a previously unidentified marine refugium in the English Channel, along with possible secondary refugia off the southwest coast of Ireland and in northeast North America and/or Iceland. Coalescent and mismatch analyses date the expansion of European populations from approximately 128,000 BP and suggest a continued period of exponential growth since then. Consequently, we postulate that the penultimate (Saale) glacial maximum was the main event in shaping the biogeographic history of European P. palmata populations which persisted throughout the last (Weichselian) glacial maximum (c. 20,000 BP) in the Hurd Deep, an enigmatic trench in the English Channel.},

@article{Larsson2007,
abstract = {Previous studies have reported higher levels of divergence for microsatellites than for allozymes in several species, suggested to reflect stabilizing selection on the allozymes. We compared the differentiation patterns of 11 allozyme and nine microsatellite loci using 679 spawning Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) collected in the Baltic and North Seas to test for differential natural selection on these markers. Observed distributions of F statistics for the two types of markers are conspicuously dissimilar, but we show that these differences can largely be explained by sampling phenomena caused by different allele frequency distributions and degrees of variability. The results show consistently low levels of differentiation for both marker types, with the exception of one outlier microsatellite locus with a notably high F(ST). The aberrant pattern at this locus is primarily due to two alleles occurring at markedly high frequencies in the Baltic, suggesting selection at this locus, or a closely linked one. When excluding this locus, the two marker types show similar, weak differentiation patterns with F(ST) values between the Baltic and the North Seas of 0.001 and 0.002 for allozymes and microsatellites, respectively. This small heterogeneity, and weak isolation by distance, is easier to distinguish statistically with microsatellites than with allozymes that have fewer alleles and skewed frequency distributions. The allozymes, however, also detect surprisingly low levels of divergence. Our results support suggestions that previously described differences between marker types are primarily caused by a small number of outlier loci.},

abstract = {A number of evolutionary mechanisms have been suggested for generating low but significant genetic structuring among marine fish populations. We used nine microsatellite loci and recently developed methods in landscape genetics and coalescence-based estimation of historical gene flow and effective population sizes to assess temporal and spatial dynamics of the population structure in European flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). We collected 1062 flounders from 13 localities in the northeast Atlantic and Baltic Seas and found temporally stable and highly significant genetic differentiation among samples covering a large part of the species' range (global F(ST) = 0.024, P {\textless} 0.0001). In addition to historical processes, a number of contemporary acting evolutionary mechanisms were associated with genetic structuring. Physical forces, such as oceanographic and bathymetric barriers, were most likely related with the extreme isolation of the island population at the Faroe Islands. A sharp genetic break was associated with a change in life history from pelagic to benthic spawners in the Baltic Sea. Partial Mantel tests showed that geographical distance per se was not related with genetic structuring among Atlantic and western Baltic Sea samples. Alternative factors, such as dispersal potential and/or environmental gradients, could be important for generating genetic divergence in this region. The results show that the magnitude and scale of structuring generated by a specific mechanism depend critically on its interplay with other evolutionary mechanisms, highlighting the importance of investigating species with wide geographical and ecological distributions to increase our understanding of evolution in the marine environment.},

abstract = {Pinpointing processes that structure the geographical distribution of genetic diversity of marine species and lead to speciation is challenging because of the lack of obvious dispersal barriers and the likelihood of substantial (passive) dispersal in oceans. In addition, cryptic radiations with sympatric distributions abound in marine species, challenging the allopatric speciation mechanism. Here, we present a phylogeographical study of the marine nematode species complex Rhabditis (Pellioditis) marina to investigate processes shaping genetic structure and speciation. Rhabditis (P.) marina lives on decaying macroalgae in the intertidal, and may therefore disperse over considerable distances. Rhabditis (P.) marina consists of several cryptic species sympatrically distributed at a local scale. Genetic variation in the COI gene was screened in 1362 specimens from 45 locations around the world. Two nuclear DNA genes (ITS and D2D3) were sequenced to infer phylogenetic species. We found evidence for ten sympatrically distributed cryptic species, seven of which show a strong genetic structuring. A historical signature showed evidence for restricted gene flow with occasional long-distance dispersal and range expansions pre-dating the last glacial maximum. Our data also point to a genetic break around the British Isles and a contact zone in the Southern Bight of the North Sea. We provide evidence for the transoceanic distribution of at least one cryptic species (PmIII) and discuss the dispersal capacity of marine nematodes. The allopatric distribution of some intraspecific phylogroups and of closely related cryptic species points to the potential for allopatric speciation in R. (P.) marina.},

abstract = {Styela clava, an ascidian native to the northwest Pacific, was first recorded in the Atlantic at Plymouth, southwest England, in 1953. It now ranges in the northeast Atlantic from Portugal to northern Denmark, and has colonized the east coast of North America. Within the region of first introduction, we aimed to characterize current genetic diversity in the species, elucidate the respective roles of human-aided vs. natural dispersal, and assess the extent of larval dispersal by looking for genetic differentiation at very small scales. Eight sites, mostly marinas, were studied along c. 200 km of coast in southwest England encompassing Plymouth. Five microsatellite loci were genotyped in 303 individuals to analyse gene flow at regional (among sites) and fine (within sites) scales. F-statistics and assignment tests were used to investigate regional genetic structure. At the fine scale, deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium was tested, and isolation by distance and genetic clustering analyses were undertaken. Significant genetic differentiation existed between sites, unrelated to geographical separation; migration between geographically distant marinas was inferred, highlighting the likely importance of human-mediated dispersal in range expansion and occupancy by S. clava. Fine-scale population structure was present within at least four sites, which may be explained by the limited dispersal ability of this ascidian and recruitment from differentiated pools of larvae. Populations in enclosed marinas had higher self-recruitment rates than those in open sites. Some marinas might therefore function as reservoirs of propagules for subsequent spread, whereas others might be sinks for migrants.},

abstract = {The spatial structuring of intraspecific genetic diversity is the result of random genetic drift, natural selection, migration, mutation, and their interaction with historical processes. The contribution of each has been typically difficult to estimate, but recent advances in statistical genetics have provided valuable new investigative tools to tackle such complexity. Using a combination of such methods, we examined the roles of environment (i.e., natural selection), random genetic processes (i.e., drift), and demography and life histories (e.g., feeding migrations) on population structure of a widely distributed and abundant marine pelagic fish of economic importance, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). Individuals were collected during peak spawning time from 19 spawning locations spanning the region from the western North Sea to the eastern Baltic Sea (N= 1859, eight microsatellite loci). We carried out separate analyses of neutral and selected genetic variation, which allowed us to establish that the two most important factors affecting population structure were selection due to salinity at spawning sites and feeding migrations. The genetic signal left by the demographic history of herring, on the other hand, seems to have been largely eroded, which is not surprising given the large reproductive potential and presumed enormous local effective population sizes of pelagic fish that constrain the effect of stochastic processes. The approach we used can in principle be applied to any abundant and widely distributed aquatic or terrestrial species.},

abstract = {An excellent model to elucidate the mechanisms and importance of evolution in the marine environment is the spectral tuning mechanism of the visual pigment in vertebrates. In the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus (Teleostei; Gobiidae), a distribution-wide study showed that spatial variation at the rhodopsin gene (RH1) matches the characteristics of specific light environments. This match suggests that populations are locally adapted to selective light regimes targeting the RH1 gene. If so, then the direction of selection should depend on the regional spatial and temporal stability of the light conditions. We tested this prediction by comparing goby populations from two regions: the Baltic Sea, characterized by divergent, but temporally stable light conditions, and the North Sea, characterized by locally heterogeneous and temporally variable light conditions. RH1 sequences of 491 Pomatoschistus minutus individuals from 15 locations were analysed. We found that variation at the RH1 gene in the Baltic populations showed signatures of diversifying selection, whereas the RH1 gene in the North Sea showed signatures of stabilizing selection. These different modes of selection are consistent with the regional light conditions and hence support our predictions, but may also be influenced by migration between the open sea and more turbid estuarine environments. An interesting observation is that within one gene, synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs show a totally different pattern between populations. Population differentiation based on non-synonymous SNPs of the RH1 gene correlated with spectral variation of the local environment of the sand goby populations. In contrast, the differentiation based on synonymous SNPs of RH1 reflects more the neutral historical pattern of the species.},

abstract = {An increasing number of phylogeographic studies on marine species shows discordant patterns in the degree of population differentiation between nuclear and mitochondrial markers. To understand better which factors have the potential to cause these patterns of discordance in marine organisms, a population genetic study was realized on the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas 1770; Gobiidae, Teleostei). Sand gobies from eight European locations were genotyped at eight microsatellite markers. Microsatellites confirmed the global phylogeographical pattern of P. minutus observed with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers and nuclear allozyme markers. Three groups consistent with the mitochondrial lineages were defined (the Mediterranean, Iberian and North Atlantic groups) and indications of a recent founder event in the northern Baltic Sea were found. Nevertheless, differences in the degree of population differentiation between the nuclear and mitochondrial markers were large (global F(ST)-values for microsatellites=0.0121; for allozymes=0.00831; for mtDNA=0.4293). Selection, sex-biased dispersal, homoplasy and a high effective population size are generally accepted as explanations for this mitonuclear discrepancy in the degree of population differentiation. In this study, selection on mtDNA and microsatellites, male-biased dispersal and homoplasy on microsatellite markers are unlikely to be a main cause for this discrepancy. The most likely reason for the discordant pattern is a recent demographical expansion of the sand goby, resulting in high effective population sizes slowing down the differentiation of nuclear DNA.},

abstract = {Heavy fishing and other anthropogenic influences can have profound impact on a species' resilience to harvesting. Besides the decrease in the census and effective population size, strong declines in mature adults and recruiting individuals may lead to almost irreversible genetic changes in life-history traits. Here, we investigated the evolution of genetic diversity and effective population size in the heavily exploited sole (Solea solea), through the analysis of historical DNA from a collection of 1379 sole otoliths dating back from 1957. Despite documented shifts in life-history traits, neutral genetic diversity inferred from 11 microsatellite markers showed a remarkable stability over a period of 50 years of heavy fishing. Using simulations and corrections for fisheries induced demographic variation, both single-sample estimates and temporal estimates of effective population size (N(e) ) were always higher than 1000, suggesting that despite the severe census size decrease over a 50-year period of harvesting, genetic drift is probably not strong enough to significantly decrease the neutral diversity of this species in the North Sea. However, the inferred ratio of effective population size to the census size (N(e) /N(c) ) appears very small (10(-5) ), suggesting that overall only a low proportion of adults contribute to the next generation. The high N(e) level together with the low N(e) /N(c) ratio is probably caused by a combination of an equalized reproductive output of younger cohorts, a decrease in generation time and a large variance in reproductive success typical for marine species. Because strong evolutionary changes in age and size at first maturation have been observed for sole, changes in adaptive genetic variation should be further monitored to detect the evolutionary consequences of human-induced selection.},

abstract = {For many years ecologists have documented the remarkable within-species variation inherent in natural systems-for example, variability in juvenile growth rates, mortality rates, fecundities, time to reproductive maturity, the outcomes of competitive interactions, and tolerance to pollutants. Over the past 20 years, it has become increasingly apparent that at least some of this variation may reflect differences in embryonic or larval experiences. Such experiences may include delayed metamorphosis, short term starvation, short term salinity stress, or exposure to sublethal concentrations of pollutants or sublethal levels of ultra violet irradiation. Latent effects-effects that have their origins in early development but that are first exhibited in juveniles or adults-have now been documented among gastropods, bivalves, echinoderms, polychaetes, crustaceans, bryozoans, urochordates, and vertebrates. The extent to which latent effects alter ecological outcomes in natural populations in the field, and the mechanisms through which they are mediated are largely unexplored.},

abstract = {In the laboratory, the swimming larvae of benthic marine invertebrates are generally capable of prolonging their larval period beyond the time that they first become physiologically competent to metamorphose. Larvae seem to differ markedly in their ability to postpone metamorphosis, both interspecifically and intraspecifically. The proportion of this variability that is genetically controlled has not yet been determined; if under genetic control, both pre-competent and competent periods would be subject to selection, although the selective pressures and the physiological or developmental mechanisms through which such pressures might operate remain purely speculative. Limited data strongly suggest that at least a few species delay metamorphosis in the field. The frequency with which they do so, and under what conditions they do so, and for how long, are unexplored questions. Some of these issues can now be explored, with the finding that various inorganic and organic substances can trigger the metamorphosis of competent larvae in a number of species; competence, and the extent to which larvae delay their metamorphosis, may now be assessed directly for field populations and in laboratory cultures, rather than by means of unreliable morphological or behavioral criteria. Careful laboratory studies may enable greater prediction of minimum and maximum dispersal periods in the field by revealing the extent to which environmental factors, such as temperature and salinity, influence pre-competent and competent periods in different species. The extent to which postponing metamorphosis alters post-metamorphic fitness is also now subject to investigation through laboratory studies and possible field transplants.},

abstract = {Geographic distributions of most temperate marine fishes are affected by postglacial recolonisation events, which have left complex genetic imprints on populations of marine species. This study investigated population structure and demographic history of European sprat (Sprattus sprattus L.) by combining inference from both mtDNA and microsatellite genetic markers throughout the species' distribution. We compared effects from genetic drift and mutation for both genetic markers in shaping genetic differentiation across four transition zones. Microsatellite markers revealed significant isolation by distance and a complex population structure across the species' distribution (overall $\theta$(ST)=0.038, P{\textless}0.01). Across transition zones markers indicated larger effects of genetic drift over mutations in the northern distribution of sprat contrasting a stronger relative impact of mutation in the species' southern distribution in the Mediterranean region. These results were interpreted to reflect more recent divergence times between northern populations in accordance with previous findings. This study demonstrates the usefulness of comparing inference from different markers and estimators of divergence for phylogeographic and population genetic studies in species with weak genetic structure, as is the case in many marine species.},

abstract = {The Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), one of the most abundant marine fishes in the world, has historically been a critical food source in Northern Europe. It is one of the few marine species that can reproduce throughout the brackish salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea. Previous studies based on few genetic markers have revealed a conspicuous lack of genetic differentiation between geographic regions, consistent with huge population sizes and minute genetic drift. Here, we present a cost-effective genome-wide study in a species that lacks a genome sequence. We first assembled a muscle transcriptome and then aligned genomic reads to the transcripts, creating an "exome assembly," capturing both exons and flanking sequences. We then resequenced pools of fish from a wide geographic range, including the Northeast Atlantic, as well as different regions in the Baltic Sea, aligned the reads to the exome assembly, and identified 440,817 SNPs. The great majority of SNPs showed no appreciable differences in allele frequency among populations; however, several thousand SNPs showed striking differences, some approaching fixation for different alleles. The contrast between low genetic differentiation at most loci and striking differences at others implies that the latter category primarily reflects natural selection. A simulation study confirmed that the distribution of the fixation index F(ST) deviated significantly from expectation for selectively neutral loci. This study provides insights concerning the population structure of an important marine fish and establishes the Atlantic herring as a model for population genetic studies of adaptation and natural selection.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the scale of dispersal and the mechanisms governing gene flow in marine environments remains fragmentary despite being essential for understanding evolution of marine biota and to design management plans. We use the limpets Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella rustica as models for identifying factors affecting gene flow in marine organisms across the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. A set of allozyme loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I were screened for genetic variation through starch gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing, respectively. An approach combining clustering algorithms with clinal analyses was used to test for the existence of barriers to gene flow and estimate their geographic location and abruptness. Sharp breaks in the genetic composition of individuals were observed in the transitions between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and across southern Italian shores. An additional break within the Atlantic cluster separates samples from the Alboran Sea and Atlantic African shores from those of the Iberian Atlantic shores. The geographic congruence of the genetic breaks detected in these two limpet species strongly supports the existence of transpecific barriers to gene flow in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeastern Atlantic. This leads to testable hypotheses regarding factors restricting gene flow across the study area.},

abstract = {Populations of widespread marine organisms are typically characterized by a low degree of genetic differentiation in neutral genetic markers, but much less is known about differentiation in genes whose functional roles are associated with specific selection regimes. To uncover possible adaptive population divergence and heterogeneous genomic differentiation in marine three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), we used a candidate gene-based genome-scan approach to analyse variability in 138 microsatellite loci located within/close to ({\textless}6 kb) functionally important genes in samples collected from ten geographic locations. The degree of genetic differentiation in markers classified as neutral or under balancing selection-as determined with several outlier detection methods-was low (F(ST) = 0.033 or 0.011, respectively), whereas average FST for directionally selected markers was significantly higher (F(ST) = 0.097). Clustering analyses provided support for genomic and geographic heterogeneity in selection: six genetic clusters were identified based on allele frequency differences in the directionally selected loci, whereas four were identified with the neutral loci. Allelic variation in several loci exhibited significant associations with environmental variables, supporting the conjecture that temperature and salinity, but not optic conditions, are important drivers of adaptive divergence among populations. In general, these results suggest that in spite of the high degree of physical connectivity and gene flow as inferred from neutral marker genes, marine stickleback populations are strongly genetically structured in loci associated with functionally relevant genes.},

However, there is frequently a lack of information on the underlying genetic and environmental drivers shaping the spatiotemporal variance in prevalence of the biomarkers employed. Here, we explore the relative role of potential variables influencing the spatiotemporal prevalence of biomarkers in dab, Limanda limanda, a species used as a bioindicator of marine contaminants. Firstly, the spatiotemporal genetic structure of dab around UK waters (39 samples across 15 sites for four years: 2005-2008) is evaluated with 16 microsatellites. Two temporally stable groups are identified corresponding to the North and Irish Seas (average between basin [Formula: see text] = 0.007; [Formula: see text] = 0.022). Secondly, we examine the association between biomarker prevalence and several variables, including genetic structuring, age and contaminant exposure. Genetic structure had significant interactive effects, together with age and some contaminants, in the prevalence of some of the biomarkers considered, namely hyperpigmentation and liver lesions. The integration of these data sets enhanced our understanding of the relationship between biomarker prevalence, exposure to contaminants and population-specific response, thereby yielding more informative predictive models of response and prospects for environmental remediation.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Central European salt habitats are mainly restricted to the maritime coast but scattered occurrences can also be found inland. In inland habitats, human activities have caused losses and reductions in the size of natural salt sites but have also created new anthropogenic habitats around potash mining dumps colonized by halophytic species in the last 30 yr. We aimed to investigate the effects of bottlenecks, isolation, and ongoing habitat fragmentation on the genetic variation of a species commonly growing in these special habitats. METHODS: We used 10 microsatellite markers to compare genetic diversity and differentiation of 31 populations of Suaeda maritima (Chenopodiaceae) from Central European coasts and inland habitats. Two approaches were applied to analyze the tetraploid data based on allele frequencies directly derived from microsatellite data and from transformed binary data. KEY RESULTS: In comparison to the coastal populations from the North Sea and the English Channel, significantly reduced genetic variation and increased between-population differentiation was revealed for populations from the German inland and the Baltic Sea coast. Genetic structure analyses clearly separated coastal and inland populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that gene flow is restricted among populations from inland salt sites and the Baltic Sea coast, presumably due to their isolation, small sizes, genetic bottlenecks and/or founder events. Patterns of allele distribution indicate some occasional genetic exchange among habitat types in the past. Anthropogenic salt sites may facilitate gene flow among inland salt habitats preventing endangered inland halophyte populations from genetic erosion.},

abstract = {Shallow population structure is generally reported for most marine fish and explained as a consequence of high dispersal, connectivity and large population size. Targeted gene analyses and more recently genome-wide studies have challenged such view, suggesting that adaptive divergence might occur even when neutral markers provide genetic homogeneity across populations. Here, 381 SNPs located in transcribed regions were used to assess large- and fine-scale population structure in the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), a widely distributed demersal species of high priority for the European fishery. Analysis of 850 individuals from 19 locations across the entire distribution range showed evidence for several outlier loci, with significantly higher resolving power. While 299 putatively neutral SNPs confirmed the genetic break between basins (F(CT) = 0.016) and weak differentiation within basins, outlier loci revealed a dramatic divergence between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations (F(CT) range 0.275-0.705) and fine-scale significant population structure. Outlier loci separated North Sea and Northern Portugal populations from all other Atlantic samples and revealed a strong differentiation among Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean geographical samples. Significant correlation of allele frequencies at outlier loci with seawater surface temperature and salinity supported the hypothesis that populations might be adapted to local conditions. Such evidence highlights the importance of integrating information from neutral and adaptive evolutionary patterns towards a better assessment of genetic diversity. Accordingly, the generated outlier SNP data could be used for tackling illegal practices in hake fishing and commercialization as well as to develop explicit spatial models for defining management units and stock boundaries.},

abstract = {Inferring the number of genetically distinct populations and their levels of connectivity is of key importance for the sustainable management and conservation of wildlife. This represents an extra challenge in the marine environment where there are few physical barriers to gene-flow, and populations may overlap in time and space. Several studies have investigated the population genetic structure within the North Atlantic minke whale with contrasting results. In order to address this issue, we analyzed ten microsatellite loci and 331 bp of the mitochondrial D-loop on 2990 whales sampled in the North East Atlantic in the period 2004 and 2007-2011. The primary findings were: (1) No spatial or temporal genetic differentiations were observed for either class of genetic marker. (2) mtDNA identified three distinct mitochondrial lineages without any underlying geographical pattern. (3) Nuclear markers showed evidence of a single panmictic population in the NE Atlantic according STRUCTURE's highest average likelihood found at Kâ=â1. (4) When Kâ=â2 was accepted, based on the Evanno's test, whales were divided into two more or less equally sized groups that showed significant genetic differentiation between them but without any sign of underlying geographic pattern. However, mtDNA for these individuals did not corroborate the differentiation. (5) In order to further evaluate the potential for cryptic structuring, a set of 100 in silico generated panmictic populations was examined using the same procedures as above showing genetic differentiation between two artificially divided groups, similar to the aforementioned observations. This demonstrates that clustering methods may spuriously reveal cryptic genetic structure. Based upon these data, we find no evidence to support the existence of spatial or cryptic population genetic structure of minke whales within the NE Atlantic. However, in order to conclusively evaluate population structure within this highly mobile species, more markers will be required.},

abstract = {Unravelling the factors shaping the genetic structure of mobile marine species is challenging due to the high potential for gene flow. However, genetic inference can be greatly enhanced by increasing the genomic, geographical or environmental resolution of population genetic studies. Here, we investigated the population structure of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) by screening 17 random and gene-linked markers in 999 individuals at 290 geographical locations throughout the northeast Atlantic Ocean. A seascape genetics approach with the inclusion of high-resolution oceanographical data was used to quantify the association of genetic variation with spatial, temporal and environmental parameters. Neutral loci identified three subgroups: an Atlantic group, a Baltic Sea group and one on the Irish Shelf. The inclusion of loci putatively under selection suggested an additional break in the North Sea, subdividing southern from northern Atlantic individuals. Environmental and spatial seascape variables correlated marginally with neutral genetic variation, but explained significant proportions (respectively, 8.7{\%} and 10.3{\%}) of adaptive genetic variation. Environmental variables associated with outlier allele frequencies included salinity, temperature, bottom shear stress, dissolved oxygen concentration and depth of the pycnocline. Furthermore, levels of explained adaptive genetic variation differed markedly between basins (3{\%} vs. 12{\%} in the North and Baltic Sea, respectively). We suggest that stable environmental selection pressure contributes to relatively strong local adaptation in the Baltic Sea. Our seascape genetic approach using a large number of sampling locations and associated oceanographical data proved useful for the identification of population units as the basis of management decisions.},

Little is also known about how the species as a whole may have historically responded to climate-driven changes in habitat availability and anthropogenic exploitation. We therefore analysed samples from over 1500 individuals collected from 22 colonies spanning the Western and Eastern Atlantic and the Baltic Sea regions, represented by 350Â bp of the mitochondrial hypervariable region and up to nine microsatellites. Strong population structure was observed at both types of marker, and highly asymmetrical patterns of gene flow were also inferred, with the Orkney Islands being identified as a source of emigrants to other areas in the Eastern Atlantic. The Baltic and Eastern Atlantic regions were estimated to have diverged a little over 10Â 000Â years ago, consistent with the last proposed isolation of the Baltic Sea. Approximate Bayesian computation also identified genetic signals consistent with postglacial population expansion across much of the species range, suggesting that grey seals are highly responsive to changes in habitat availability.},

abstract = {Parallel patterns of adaptive divergence and speciation are cited as powerful evidence for the role of selection driving these processes. However, it is often not clear whether parallel phenotypic divergence is underlain by parallel genetic changes. Here, we asked about the genetic basis of parallel divergence in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis, which has repeatedly evolved coexisting ecotypes adapted to either crab predation or wave action. We sequenced the transcriptome of snails of both ecotypes from three distant geographical locations (Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) and mapped the reads to the L. saxatilis reference genome. We identified genomic regions potentially under divergent selection between ecotypes within each country, using an outlier approach based on F(ST) values calculated per locus. In line with previous studies indicating that gene reuse is generally common, we expected to find extensive sharing of outlier loci due to recent shared ancestry and gene flow between at least two of the locations in our study system. Contrary to our expectations, we found that most outliers were country specific, suggesting that much of the genetic basis of divergence is not shared among locations. However, we did find that more outliers were shared than expected by chance and that differentiation of shared outliers is often generated by the same SNPs. We discuss two mechanisms potentially explaining the limited amount of sharing we observed. First, a polygenic basis of divergent traits might allow for multiple distinct molecular mechanisms generating the same phenotypic patterns. Second, additional, location-specific axes of selection that we did not focus on in this study may produce distinct patterns of genetic divergence within each site.},

abstract = {The last glacial maximum (20,000-18,000 years ago) dramatically affected extant distributions of virtually all northern European biota. Locations of refugia and postglacial recolonization pathways were examined in Fucus serratus (Heterokontophyta; Fucaceae) using a highly variable intergenic spacer developed from the complete mitochondrial genome of Fucus vesiculosus. Over 1,500 samples from the entire range of F. serratus were analysed using fluorescent single strand conformation polymorphism. A total of 28 mtDNA haplotypes was identified and sequenced. Three refugia were recognized based on high haplotype diversities and the presence of endemic haplotypes: southwest Ireland, the northern Brittany-Hurd Deep area of the English Channel, and the northwest Iberian Peninsula. The Irish refugium was the source for a recolonization sweep involving a single haplotype via northern Scotland and throughout Scandinavia, whereas recolonization from the Brittany-Hurd Deep refugium was more limited, probably because of unsuitable soft-bottom habitat in the Bay of Biscay and along the Belgian and Dutch coasts. The Iberian populations reflect a remnant refugium at the present-day southern boundary of the species range. A generalized skyline plot suggested exponential population expansion beginning in the mid-Pleistocene with maximal growth during the Eems interglacial 128,000-67,000 years ago, implying that the last glacial maximum mainly shaped population distributions rather than demography.},

abstract = {The phylogeography of thornback rays (Raja clavata) was assessed from European waters, using five nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial cytochome b sequences. Strong regional differentiation was found between the Mediterranean basin, the Azores and the European continental shelf. Allelic and haplotype diversities were high in Portuguese populations, consistent with the existence of a refugium along the Iberian Peninsula. Unexpectedly, high diversity was also found in the English Channel/North Sea area. The lowest genetic diversity was found in the Black Sea. Populations sampled from the Mediterranean, Adriatic and Black Seas were characterized by a single mitochondrial haplotype. This haplotype was also the most ancestral and widespread outside of the Mediterranean basin except for the Azores. Populations from the Azores were dominated by a second ancestral haplotype which was shared with British populations. Results from multidimensional scaling, amova and nested clade analysis indicate that British waters are a secondary contact zone recolonized from at least two refugia--one around the Iberian Peninsula and one possibly in the Azores. Links to a potential refugium known as the Hurd Deep, between Cornwall and Brittany, are discussed. Finally, a historical demographic analysis indicates that thornback ray populations started to expand between 580,000 and 362,000 years ago, which suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum (20,000 years ago) had mainly affected the distribution of populations rather than population size.},

abstract = {Determining the mechanisms that generate population structure is essential to the understanding of speciation and the evolution of biodiversity. Here, we investigate a geographical range that transects two habitat gradients, the North Sea to North Atlantic transition, and the temperate to subpolar regions. We studied the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a small odontocete inhabiting both subpolar and temperate waters. To assess differentiation among putative populations, we measured morphological variation at cranial traits (N = 462 individuals) and variation at eight microsatellite loci for 338 of the same individuals from Norwegian, British and Danish waters. Significant morphological differentiation reflected the size of the buccal cavity. Porpoises forage in relatively shallow waters preying mainly on benthic species in British and Danish waters, and on mesopelagic and pelagic fish off the coast of Norway. We suggest that the observed differentiation may be explained by resource specialization and either adaptation or developmental responses to different local habitats.},

abstract = {The European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has been a prime example of the panmixia paradigm because of its extraordinary adaptation to the North Atlantic gyral system, semelparous spawning in the Sargasso Sea and long trans-oceanic migration. Recently, this view was challenged by the suggestion of a genetic structure characterized by an isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern. This is only likely if spawning subpopulations are spatially and/or temporally separated, followed by non-random larval dispersal. A limitation of previous genetic work on eels is the lack of replication over time to test for temporal stability of genetic structure. Here, we hypothesize that temporal genetic variation plays a significant role in explaining the spatial structure reported earlier for this species. We tested this by increasing the texture of geographical sampling and by including temporal replicates. Overall genetic differentiation among samples was low, highly significant and comparable with earlier studies (FST = 0.0014; p {\textless} 0.01). On the other hand, and in sharp contrast with current understandings, hierarchical analyses revealed no significant inter-location genetic heterogeneity and hence no IBD. Instead, genetic variation among temporal samples within sites clearly exceeded the geographical component. Our results provide support for the panmixia hypothesis and emphasize the importance of temporal replication when assessing population structure of marine fish species.},

abstract = {Previous studies of genetic structure in the European eel have resulted in seemingly conflicting results, ranging from no detectable heterogeneity to small but statistically significant differences and isolation by distance patterns among eels sampled across the continental range. Differences with respect to sampling design and choice of molecular markers, combined with a lack of power estimates, complicate comparisons of existing results. In this study we have used six microsatellite markers and, for the first time, compared maturing silver eels of known age from southern and northern Europe (Italy and Baltic Sea). In comparison with previous studies, our data may give a better representation of potential spawning stocks because eels were sampled when having begun their migration toward the presumed spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. Despite large sample sizes (404 and 806 individuals) we could not observe any signs of genetic differentiation (average F(ST)=-0.00003, P=0.61), and a power analysis showed that the true level of heterogeneity (if existing) must be exceedingly small to have remained undetected (say, F(ST) {\textless}0.0004). A tendency for slightly increased genetic differences between cohorts over time could be seen, but the amount of temporal change was minor and not statistically significant. Our findings reiterate the notion that previous reports of continental genetic differentiation in the European eel may be largely explained by uncontrolled temporal variation between juvenile glass eel samples.},

abstract = {In order to elucidate the evolutionary history and the population structure of the members of the phylum Cycliophora, which live commensally on three species of lobsters, we studied sequence variation in the mitochondrial gene cyctochrome c oxidase subunit I. Overall 242 sequences from 16 locations on both coasts of the North Atlantic, including the North Sea and the Mediterranean, were analysed, revealing 28 haplotypes, with a maximum sequence divergence of 16.6{\%}. Total genetic diversity was high (h = 0.8322, pi = 0.0898), as it was for the commensals on Homarus americanus (17 haplotypes, h = 0.7506, pi = 0.0504). However, it was low for commensals on Nephrops norvegicus (6 haplotypes, h = 0.3899, pi = 0.0035), and intermediate for cycliophorans on \textit{Homarus gammarus} (5 haplotypes, h = 0.3020, pi = 0.0140). Although two of the host lobsters co-inhabit the coastal waters of Europe, a strong genetic structure (78.45{\%} of the observed genetic variation) was detected among populations on all host species, indicating the existence of a reproductively isolated species on each lobster. In addition, genetic structure over long distances exists among populations on each host species. Such patterns can be explained by the limited dispersal ability of the cycliophoran chordoid larva. Demographic and phylogenetic analyses suggest old and possibly cryptic populations present on H. americanus and H. gammarus, while the latter may have experienced recent bottlenecks, perhaps during Pleistocene glaciations. Populations on N. norvegicus appear to be of recent origin.},

abstract = {The geological history of the Mediterranean Sea, its hydrography and connection with the Atlantic Ocean have been well documented. Despite a wealth of historical and oceanographic data, the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition remains controversial at the biological level as there are discordant results regarding the biogeographical separation between the Atlantic and Mediterranean biota. The opening of the Strait of Gibraltar at the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (some 5.33 million years ago), removed the land barrier that impeded the marine biota allowing it to disperse freely into the Mediterranean Sea. However, present day genetic patterns suggest a limitation to gene flow for some marine species, preventing population admixture. In the last few years, a large number of studies have challenged the hypothesis of the Strait of Gibraltar representing a phylogeographical break. A review of more than 70 papers reveals no obvious relationship between either dispersal ability or life history, and observed patterns of partial or complete genetic isolation between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. We re-analysed a selection of this large body of data (20 studies in total) in order to provide a homogeneous and coherent view on the generality of the phylogeographical patterns and the presence of a phylogeographical barrier. This offered the opportunity to summarize the state of the art on this matter and reach some general conclusions on the evolutionary history across the Atlantic-Mediterranean range. Geographically, some species in the transition zone showed step changes of allele frequencies associated with the Almeria-Oran Front rather than with the Strait of Gibraltar itself. A major part of the data describe evolutionary events well within the time frame of the Quaternary age as very few taxa pre-date closure of the Tethys Sea. Results point to a combined signature of vicariance, palaeoclimate fluctuation and life-history traits on the Atlantic-Mediterranean phylogeographical patterns. Principal component analysis failed to show any particular association between biological traits and genetic variables. It would argue that organismal determinism may play a far less significant role than marine biogeographers have generally believed.},

abstract = {The European spiny lobster (Palinurus elephas) is a suitable model organism to study the effects of past history and current oceanographic processes on the genetic diversity and population structure of marine species with a long-lived larval phase. A portion of the COI gene was sequenced in 227 individuals from 11 localities, covering most of the present distribution of the species. Divergence was found between Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, which could be explained by restricted gene flow between populations. Moreover, a principal component analysis detected differences within basins. The existence of genetic differentiation between Brittany and Ireland-Scotland populations could be accounted for by the large effect of the Gulf Stream, while mesoscale processes suffered by the incoming Atlantic waters could be responsible of genetic differentiation within the Mediterranean. Furthermore, historical processes could be responsible for a reduction on the overall genetic variability of P. elephas. The haplotypic distribution found in P. elephas, with the presence of one abundant haplotype and a large number of closely related haplotypes, is typical of species experiencing reduction in variability and subsequent expansions. Climatic fluctuations related to glacial cycles could explain the present level of variability and nucleotide diversity found. Interestingly, these glacial events do not seem to have the same impact in other species of the same genus. Our results indicate that recent glacial events could have had a lower impact on Palinurus mauritanicus, a congeneric species that presents an overlapping distribution area but is found in cooler waters than P. elephas.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technology provides novel opportunities for gathering genome-scale sequence data in natural populations, laying the empirical foundation for the evolving field of population genomics. Here we conducted a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation in natural populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100 individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations. Overall estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations confirm the biogeographic hypothesis that large panmictic oceanic populations have repeatedly given rise to phenotypically divergent freshwater populations. Genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both balancing and divergent selection were remarkably consistent across multiple, independently derived populations, indicating that replicate parallel phenotypic evolution in stickleback may be occurring through extensive, parallel genetic evolution at a genome-wide scale. Some of these genomic regions co-localize with previously identified QTL for stickleback phenotypic variation identified using laboratory mapping crosses. In addition, we have identified several novel regions showing parallel differentiation across independent populations. Annotation of these regions revealed numerous genes that are candidates for stickleback phenotypic evolution and will form the basis of future genetic analyses in this and other organisms. This study represents the first high-density SNP-based genome scan of genetic diversity and differentiation for populations of threespine stickleback in the wild. These data illustrate the complementary nature of laboratory crosses and population genomic scans by confirming the adaptive significance of previously identified genomic regions, elucidating the particular evolutionary and demographic history of such regions in natural populations, and identifying new genomic regions and candidate genes of evolutionary significance.},

One hundred and twenty-two AFLP loci were analysed in 159 individuals from eight populations from across the species' range and revealed high levels of genetic diversity, with all individuals but two harbouring a unique banding pattern. As reported for other marine invertebrates, we found high levels of genetic differentiation between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins, suggesting that the Strait of Gibraltar represents a major barrier to dispersal for this sea star. Our assignment studies suggest that, in the Atlantic, a measurable degree of gene flow occurs between populations, which could result in the isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation observed in this basin. In contrast, no evidence of contemporary gene flow was found in the Mediterranean, suggesting contrasting patterns of dispersal of Asterina gibbosa in the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins.},

abstract = {Marginal populations are often isolated and under extreme selection pressures resulting in anomalous genetics. Consequently, ecosystems that are geographically and ecologically marginal might have a large share of genetically atypical populations, in need of particular concern in management of these ecosystems. To test this prediction, we analysed genetic data from 29 species inhabiting the low saline Baltic Sea, a geographically and ecologically marginal ecosystem. On average Baltic populations had lost genetic diversity compared to Atlantic populations: a pattern unrelated to dispersal capacity, generation time of species and taxonomic group of organism, but strongly related to type of genetic marker (mitochondrial DNA loci had lost c. 50{\%} diversity, and nuclear loci 10{\%}). Analyses of genetic isolation by geographic distance revealed clinal patterns of differentiation between Baltic and Atlantic regions. For a majority of species, clines were sigmoid with a sharp slope around the Baltic Sea entrance, indicating impeded gene flows between Baltic and Atlantic populations. Some species showed signs of allele frequencies being perturbed at the edge of their distribution inside the Baltic Sea. Despite the short geological history of the Baltic Sea (8000 years), populations inhabiting the Baltic have evolved substantially different from Atlantic populations, probably as a consequence of isolation and bottlenecks, as well as selection on adaptive traits. In addition, the Baltic Sea also acts a refuge for unique evolutionary lineages. This marginal ecosystem is thus vulnerable but also exceedingly valuable, housing unique genes, genotypes and populations that constitute an important genetic resource for management and conservation.},

abstract = {One mechanism by which marine organisms may respond to climate shifts is range shifts. The corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) is a temperate fish species, inhabiting the coasts of Europe, that show strong indications of current as well as historical (ice-age) range shifts towards the north. Nine neutral microsatellite DNA markers were screened to study genetic signatures and spatial population structure over the entire geographic and thermal gradient of the species from Portugal to Norway. A major genetic break (F ST â=â0.159 average among pairs) was identified between Scandinavian and more southern populations, with a marked reduction (30{\%} or more) in levels of genetic variability in Scandinavia. The break is probably related to bottleneck(s) associated with post-glacial colonization of the Scandinavian coasts, and indicates a lack of present gene flow across the North Sea. The lack of gene flow can most likely be attributed to the species' need for rocky substrate for nesting and a relatively short pelagic larval phase, limiting dispersal by ocean currents. These findings demonstrate that long-distance dispersal may be severely limited in the corkwing wrasse, and that successful range-shifts following present climate change may be problematic for this and other species with limited dispersal abilities, even in the seemingly continuous marine environment.},

abstract = {Estimates of the average distances by which marine larvae disperse are generally poorly described, despite the central role that larval dispersal plays in the demographic connectivity of populations across geographic space. Here, we describe the population genetic structure and average dispersal distance of the netted dog whelk Nassarius reticulatus (L.) (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Prosobranchia), a widespread member of European intertidal communities, using DNA sequence variation in a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). An analysis of 156 individuals from 6 locations spread across approximately 1700 km of the European Atlantic coastline revealed weak and nonsignificant population structure (overall Phi(ST) = 0.00013). However, pairwise Phi(ST) values revealed a slight but significant increase in genetic isolation with geographic distance (IBD), suggesting that populations are not panmictic across the sampled geographic range. If we assume that the isolation by distance is maintained by a stable, stepping stone model of gene flow, then the slope of the IBD is consistent with an average larval dispersal distance of approximately 70 km per generation. The spatial scale of larval dispersal in N. reticulatus is consistent with the life cycle of the species (planktotrophic veliger lasting 30-60 days before competent to settle). A mismatch analysis of the COI sequences revealed a signature of an ancient demographic expansion that began 61 500-160,000 years ago, well before the most recent Pleistocene glaciation event. The greatest levels of genetic diversity occur within the middle latitudes of the whelk's geographic range, consistent with the notion that historic populations of N. reticulatus might have expanded northward and southward from the centrally located Bay of Biscay.},

abstract = {This study uses enzymatic and mitochondrial genes to infer the relative importance of historical processes and contemporary hydrodynamic features on the observed patterns of genetic structure in subdivided populations of Pectinaria koreni (Polychaeta: Pectinariidae) along the coasts of Brittany and the English Channel. Nucleotide sequence variation of a 603-bp fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene revealed a surprisingly deep phylogeographic break of about 16{\%} divergence separating the Brittany and Channel populations, which coincides with a biogeographic boundary along the western coast of Brittany. Deep sequence divergence with fixed haplotype differences and the inversion of allele frequencies at two enzyme loci suggests the occurrence of potential cryptic or sibling species of P. koreni. The two clades showed opposite features. Channel populations exhibited bimodal match-mismatch curves due to two highly divergent haplotypes occurring at high frequencies and no overall heterozygote deficiencies at enzyme loci, suggesting respectively, a historic secondary contact between two differentiated populations followed by contemporary panmixia. On the contrary, Brittany populations displayed unimodal curves with low nucleotide diversity and highly significant heterozygote deficiencies, probably reminiscent of a recent population expansion and recolonisation of Brittany with contemporary admixture of divergent populations.},

abstract = {The marine bryozoan Celleporella hyalina is a species complex composed of many highly divergent and mostly allopatric genetic lineages that are reproductively isolated but share a remarkably similar morphology. One such lineage commonly encrusts macroalgae throughout the NE Atlantic coast. To explore the processes leading to geographical diversification, reproductive isolation and speciation in this taxon, we (i) investigated NE Atlantic C. hyalina mitochondrial DNA phylogeography, and (ii) used breeding trials between geographical isolates to ascertain reproductive isolation. We find that haplotype diversity is geographically variable and there is a strong population structure, with significant isolation by distance. NE Atlantic C. hyalina is structured into two main parapatric lineages that appear to have had independent Pleistocene histories. Range expansions have resulted in two contact zones in Spain and W Ireland. Lineage 1 is found from Ireland to Spain and has low haplotype diversity, with closely related haplotypes, suggesting a recent population expansion into the Irish Sea, S Ireland, S England and Spain. Lineage 2 is found from Iceland to Spain and has high haplotype diversity. Complete reproductive isolation was found between some geographical isolates representing both lineages, whereas it was incomplete or asymmetric between others, suggesting these latter phylogeographical groups probably represent incipient species. The phylogeographical distribution of NE Atlantic C. hyalina does not fall easily into a pattern of southern refugia, and we discuss likely differences between terrestrial and marine system responses to Pleistocene glacial cycles.},

abstract = {Probably half of all animal species exhibit a parasitic lifestyle and numerous parasites have recently expanded their distribution and host ranges due to anthropogenic activities. Here, we report on the population genetic structure of the invasive nematode Anguillicola crassus, a parasite in freshwater eels, which recently spread from Asia to Europe and North America. Samples were collected from the newly colonized naive host species Anguilla anguilla (Europe) and Anguilla rostrata (North America), and from indigenous Anguilla japonica in Taiwan and Japan. Using seven microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial marker, we show that the parasite's population structure in Europe mirrors the zoogeographic Boreal-Lusitanian break along the English Channel. Both the north-to-south decline of nuclear allelic diversity and the loss of private alleles in the same direction are consistent with a significant isolation-by-distance pattern based on rho(ST) values. In combination with the specific topology of the distance tree among nematode populations, our data suggest that Europe was invaded only once from Taiwan, and that subsequently, genetic diversity was lost due to random drift. On the contrary, the North American sample shares distinct nuclear and mitochondrial signatures with Japanese specimens. We propose that the genetic structure in Europe was shaped by long-range anthropogenic eel host transfers in the north and a single dispersal event into the southwest. The genetically distinct Brittany sample at the edge of the Boreal-Lusitanian boundary is indicative of natural dispersal of fish hosts since recruitment occurs naturally there and invertebrate host dissemination is interrupted due to oceanic currents.},

abstract = {The European green crab, Carcinus maenas, has a native distribution that extends from Norway to Mauritania. It has attracted attention because of its recent invasions of Australia, Tasmania, South Africa, Japan and both coasts of North America. To examine the population structure of this global invader in its native range, we analysed a 502-base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene from 217 crabs collected in the North Atlantic and 13 specimens from the Mediterranean. A clear genetic break (11{\%} sequence divergence) occurs between the Mediterranean and Atlantic, supporting the species-level status of these two forms. Populations in the Faeroe Islands and Iceland were genetically distinct from continental populations (F(ST) = 0.264-0.678), with Iceland represented by a single lineage also found in the Faeroes. This break is consistent with a deep-water barrier to dispersal in green crabs. Although there are relatively high levels of gene flow along the Atlantic coast of Europe, slight population structure was found between the central North Sea and populations to the south. Analysis of variance, multidimensional scaling, and the distribution of private haplotypes support this break, located between Bremerhaven, Germany, and Hoek van Holland. Similar biogeographical and genetic associations for other species, such as benthic algae and freshwater eels, suggest that the marine fauna of Europe may be generally subdivided into the areas of Mediterranean, western Europe and northern Europe.},

abstract = {Little is known about the spatial and temporal scales at which planktonic organisms are genetically structured. A previous study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the holoplanktonic chaetognath Sagitta setosa revealed strong phylogeographic structuring suggesting that Northeast (NE) Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea populations are genetically disjunct. The present study used a higher sampling intensity and a combination of mitochondrial and four microsatellite markers to reveal population structuring between and within basins. Between basins, both marker sets indicated significant differentiation confirming earlier results that gene flow is probably absent between the respective S. setosa populations. At the within-basin scale, we found no evidence of spatial or temporal structuring within the NE Atlantic. In the Mediterranean basin, both marker sets indicated significant structuring, but only the mtDNA data indicated a sharp genetic division between Adriatic and all other Mediterranean populations. Data were inconclusive about population structuring in the Black Sea. The levels of differentiation indicated by the two marker sets differed substantially, with far less pronounced structure detected by microsatellite than mtDNA data. This study also uncovered the presence of highly divergent mitochondrial lineages that were discordant with morphology, geography and nuclear DNA. We thus propose the hypothesis that highly divergent mitochondrial lineages may be present within interbreeding S. setosa populations.},

Yet, no verified genetic information on population substructure existed for the northern distribution range of this species in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. So far, reproductive and migration behaviour and in vitro oxygen binding properties of haemocyanin have suggested the existence of separate populations in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. Examination of genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci within samples from the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the southern North Sea indicated low levels of genetic differentiation in this area but also a breakdown of free gene flow at highly significant average F(ST)=0.018. Although there is a considerable genetic exchange between populations of S. officinalis in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, they cannot be regarded as a single, freely interbreeding population. Earlier reported biological differences might thus be due to genetic variability between the populations.},

abstract = {Understanding the patterns of genetic variation within and among populations is a central problem in population and evolutionary genetics. We examine this question in the acorn barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, in which the allozyme loci Mpi and Gpi have been implicated in balancing selection due to varying selective pressures at different spatial scales. We review the patterns of genetic variation at the Mpi locus, compare this to levels of population differentiation at mtDNA and microsatellites, and place these data in the context of genome-wide variation from high-throughput sequencing of population samples spanning the North Atlantic. Despite considerable geographic variation in the patterns of selection at the Mpi allozyme, this locus shows rather low levels of population differentiation at ecological and trans-oceanic scales (F(ST) {\~{}} 5{\%}). Pooled population sequencing was performed on samples from Rhode Island (RI), Maine (ME), and Southwold, England (UK). Analysis of more than 650 million reads identified approximately 335,000 high-quality SNPs in 19 million base pairs of the S. balanoides genome. Much variation is shared across the Atlantic, but there are significant examples of strong population differentiation among samples from RI, ME, and UK. An F(ST) outlier screen of more than 22,000 contigs provided a genome-wide context for interpretation of earlier studies on allozymes, mtDNA, and microsatellites. F(ST) values for allozymes, mtDNA and microsatellites are close to the genome-wide average for random SNPs, with the exception of the trans-Atlantic F(ST) for mtDNA. The majority of F(ST) outliers were unique between individual pairs of populations, but some genes show shared patterns of excess differentiation. These data indicate that gene flow is high, that selection is strong on a subset of genes, and that a variety of genes are experiencing diversifying selection at large spatial scales. This survey of polymorphism in S. balanoides provides a number of genomic tools that promise to make this a powerful model for ecological genomics of the rocky intertidal.},

abstract = {Population genetic structure of sedentary marine species is expected to be shaped mainly by the dispersal ability of their larvae. Long-lived planktonic larvae can connect populations through migration and gene flow, whereas species with nondispersive benthic or direct-developing larvae are expected to have genetically differentiated populations. Poecilogonous species producing different larval types are ideal when studying the effect of developmental mode on population genetic structure and connectivity. In the spionid polychaete Pygospio elegans, different larval types have been observed between, and sometimes also within, populations. We used microsatellite markers to study population structure of European P. elegans from the Baltic Sea (BS) and North Sea (NS). We found that populations with planktonic larvae had higher genetic diversity than did populations with benthic larvae. However, this pattern may not be related to developmental mode, since in P. elegans, developmental mode may be associated with geography. Benthic larvae were more commonly seen in the brackish BS and planktonic larvae were predominant in the NS, although both larval types also are found from both areas. Significant isolation-by-distance (IBD) was found overall and within regions. Most of the pair-wise F(ST) comparisons among populations were significant, although some geographically close populations with planktonic larvae were found to be genetically similar. However, these results, together with the pattern of IBD, autocorrelation within populations, as well as high estimated local recruitment, suggest that dispersal is limited in populations with planktonic larvae as well as in those with benthic larvae. The decrease in salinity between the NS and BS causes a barrier to gene flow in many marine species. In P. elegans, low, but significant, differentiation was detected between the NS and BS (3.34{\%} in AMOVA), but no clear transition zone was observed, indicating that larvae are not hampered by the change in salinity.},

abstract = {Little consideration has been given to the genetic composition of populations associated with marine reserves, as reserve designation is generally to protect specific species, communities or habitats. Nevertheless, it is important to conserve genetic diversity since it provides the raw material for the maintenance of species diversity over longer, evolutionary time-scales and may also confer the basis for adaptation to environmental change. Many current marine reserves are small in size and isolated to some degree (e.g. sea loughs and offshore islands). While such features enable easier management, they may have important implications for the genetic structure of protected populations, the ability of populations to recover from local catastrophes and the potential for marine reserves to act as sources of propagules for surrounding areas. Here, we present a case study demonstrating genetic differentiation, isolation, inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity in populations of the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus in Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve (an isolated sea lough in southern Ireland), compared with populations on the local adjacent open coast and populations in England, Wales and France. Our study demonstrates that this sea lough is isolated from open coast populations, and highlights that there may be long-term genetic consequences of selecting reserves on the basis of isolation and ease of protection.},

abstract = {Phylogeographic studies provide critical insight into the evolutionary histories of model organisms; yet, to date, range-wide data are lacking for the rough periwinkle Littorina saxatilis, a classic example of marine sympatric speciation. Here, we use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data to demonstrate that L. saxatilis is not monophyletic for this marker, but is composed of two distinct mtDNA lineages (I and II) that are shared with sister species Littorina arcana and Littorina compressa. Bayesian coalescent dating and phylogeographic patterns indicate that both L. saxatilis lineages originated in the eastern North Atlantic, around the British Isles, at approximately 0.64 Ma. Both lineages are now distributed broadly across the eastern, central and western North Atlantic, and show strong phylogeographic structure among regions. The Iberian Peninsula is genetically distinct, suggesting prolonged isolation from northeastern North Atlantic populations. Western North Atlantic populations of L. saxatilis lineages I and II predate the last glacial maximum and have been isolated from eastern North Atlantic populations since that time. This identification of two distinct, broadly distributed mtDNA lineages further complicates observed patterns of repeated incipient ecological speciation in L. saxatilis, because the sympatric origins of distinct ecotype pairs on eastern North Atlantic shores may be confounded by admixture of divergent lineages.},

abstract = {Pleistocene climate changes have imposed extreme conditions to intertidal rocky marine communities, forcing many species to significant range shifts in their geographical distributions. Phylogeographic analyses based on both mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers provide a useful approach to unravel phylogeographic patterns and processes of species after this time period, to gain general knowledge of how climatic changes affect shifts in species distributions. We analyzed these patterns on the corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops, Labridae), a rocky shore species inhabiting North Sea waters and temperate northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Norway to Morocco including the Azores, using a fragment of the mitochondrial control region and the first intron of the nuclear S7 ribosomal protein gene. We found that S. melops shows a clear differentiation between the Atlantic and the Scandinavian populations and a sharp contrast in the genetic diversity, high in the south and low in the north. Within each of these main geographic areas there is little or no genetic differentiation. The species may have persisted throughout the last glacial maximum in the southern areas as paleotemperatures were not lower than they are today in North Scandinavia. The North Sea recolonization most likely took place during the current interglacial and is dominated by a haplotype absent from the south of the study area, but present in Plymouth and Belfast. The possibility of a glacial refugium in or near the English Channel is discussed.},

abstract = {Scanning genomes for loci with high levels of population differentiation has become a standard of population genetics. F(ST) outlier loci are most often interpreted as signatures of local selection, but outliers might arise for many other reasons too often left unexplored. Here, we tried to identify further the history and genetic basis underlying strong differentiation at F(ST) outlier loci in a marine mussel. A genome scan of genetic differentiation has been conducted between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of Mytilus galloprovincialis. The differentiation was low overall (F(ST) = 0.03), but seven loci (2{\%}) were strong F(ST) outliers. We then analysed DNA sequence polymorphism at two outlier loci. The genetic structure proved to be the consequence of differential introgression of alleles from the sister-hybridizing species Mytilus edulis. Surprisingly, the Mediterranean population was the most introgressed at these two loci, although the contact zone between the two species is nowadays localized along the Atlantic coasts of France and the British Isles. A historical contact between M. edulis and Mediterranean M. galloprovincialis should have happened during glacial periods. It proved difficult to disentangle two hypotheses: (i) introgression was adaptive, implying edulis alleles have been favoured in Mediterranean populations, or (ii) the genetic architecture of the barrier to edulis gene flow is different between the two M. galloprovincialis backgrounds. Five of the seven outliers between M. galloprovincialis populations were also outliers between M. edulis and Atlantic M. galloprovincialis, which would support the latter hypothesis. Differential introgression across semi-permeable barriers to gene flow is a neglected scenario to interpret outlying loci that may prove more widespread than anticipated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Temporal variation in the genetic structure of populations can be caused by multiple factors, including natural selection, stochastic environmental variation, migration, or genetic drift. In benthic marine species, the developmental mode of larvae may indicate a possibility for temporal genetic variation: species with dispersive planktonic larvae are expected to be more likely to show temporal genetic variation than species with benthic or brooded non-dispersive larvae, due to differences in larval mortality and dispersal ability. We examined temporal genetic structure in populations of Pygospio elegans, a poecilogonous polychaete with within-species variation in developmental mode. P. elegans produces either planktonic, benthic, or intermediate larvae, varying both among and within populations, providing a within-species test of the generality of a relationship between temporal genetic variation and larval developmental mode.

RESULTS: In contrast to our expectations, our microsatellite analyses of P. elegans revealed temporal genetic stability in the UK population with planktonic larvae, whereas there was variation indicative of drift in temporal samples of the populations from the Baltic Sea, which have predominantly benthic and intermediate larvae. We also detected temporal variation in relatedness within these populations. A large temporal shift in genetic structure was detected in a population from the Netherlands, having multiple developmental modes. This shift could have been caused by local extiction due to extreme environmental conditions and (re)colonization by planktonic larvae from neighboring populations.

CONCLUSIONS: In our study of P. elegans, temporal genetic variation appears to be due to not only larval developmental mode, but also the stochastic environment of adults. Large temporal genetic shifts may be more likely in marine intertidal habitats (e.g. North Sea and Wadden Sea) which are more prone to environmental stochasticity than the sub-tidal Baltic habitats. Sub-tidal and/or brackish (less saline) habitats may support smaller P. elegans populations and these may be more susceptible to the effects of random genetic drift. Moreover, higher frequencies of asexual reproduction and the benthic larval developmental mode in these populations leads to higher relatedness and contributes to drift. Our results indicate that a general relationship between larval developmental mode and temporal genetic variation may not exist.},

abstract = {Maerl beds are sensitive biogenic habitats built by an accumulation of loose-lying, non-geniculate coralline algae. While these habitats are considered hot-spots of marine biodiversity, the number and distribution of maerl-forming species is uncertain because homoplasy and plasticity of morphological characters are common. As a result, species discrimination based on morphological features is notoriously challenging, making these coralline algae the ideal candidates for a DNA barcoding study. Here, mitochondrial (COI-5P DNA barcode fragment) and plastidial (psbA gene) sequence data were used in a two-step approach to delimit species in 224 collections of maerl sampled from Svalbard (78Â°96'N) to the Canary Islands (28Â°64'N) that represented 10 morphospecies from four genera and two families. First, the COI-5P dataset was analyzed with two methods based on distinct criteria (ABGD and GMYC) to delineate 16 primary species hypotheses (PSHs) arranged into four major lineages. Second, chloroplast (psbA) sequence data served to consolidate these PSHs into 13 secondary species hypotheses (SSHs) that showed biologically plausible ranges. Using several lines of evidence (e.g. morphological characters, known species distributions, sequences from type and topotype material), six SSHs were assigned to available species names that included the geographically widespread Phymatolithon calcareum, Lithothamnion corallioides, and L. glaciale; possible identities of other SSHs are discussed. Concordance between SSHs and morphospecies was minimal, highlighting the convenience of DNA barcoding for an accurate identification of maerl specimens. Our survey indicated that a majority of maerl forming species have small distribution ranges and revealed a gradual replacement of species with latitude.},

At the intersection of these aims lies potential conflict, signalling the need for integrated, cross-border management approaches. This paper focuses on the marine megafauna of the region. This guild of consumers was formerly abundant, but is now depleted and protected under various national and international legislative structures. We present a meta-analysis of available megafauna datasets using presence-only distribution models to characterise suitable habitat and identify spatially-important regions within the English Channel and southern bight of the North Sea. The integration of studies from dedicated and opportunistic observer programmes in the United Kingdom and France provide a valuable perspective on the spatial and seasonal distribution of various taxonomic groups, including large pelagic fishes and sharks, marine mammals, seabirds and marine turtles. The Western English Channel emerged as a hotspot of biodiversity for megafauna, while species richness was low in the Eastern English Channel. Spatial conservation planning is complicated by the highly mobile nature of marine megafauna, however they are important components of the marine environment and understanding their distribution is a first crucial step toward their inclusion into marine ecosystem management.},

There remains a need for a simple, inexpensive platform that allows high-density SNP discovery and genotyping in large populations. Here we describe the sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) tags, which identified more than 13,000 SNPs, and mapped three traits in two model organisms, using less than half the capacity of one Illumina sequencing run. We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F(2) individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

We explore the performance of existing analysis tools given these biases and discuss approaches to limiting or handling biases in RAD-Seq data.

Two approaches, empirical genetic patterns and oceanographic dispersal modelling, have been used to estimate levels of evolutionary connectivity among marine populations but rarely have their potentially complementary insights been combined. Here, a spatially realistic Lagrangian model of larval dispersal and a theoretical genetic model are integrated with the most extensive study of gene flow in a Caribbean marine organism. The 871 genets collected from 26 sites spread over the wider Caribbean subsampled 45.8{\%} of the 1900 potential unique genets in the model. At a coarse scale, significant consensus between modelled estimates of genetic structure and empirical genetic data for populations of the reef-building coral Montastraea annularis is observed. However, modelled and empirical data differ in their estimates of connectivity among northern Mesoamerican reefs indicating that processes other than dispersal may dominate here. Further, the geographic location and porosity of the previously described east-west barrier to gene flow in the Caribbean is refined. A multi-prong approach, integrating genetic data and spatially realistic models of larval dispersal and genetic projection, provides complementary insights into the processes underpinning population connectivity in marine invertebrates on evolutionary timescales.},

abstract = {Temperature-induced mass coral bleaching causing mortality on a wide geographic scale started when atmospheric CO(2) levels exceeded approximately 320 ppm. When CO(2) levels reached approximately 340 ppm, sporadic but highly destructive mass bleaching occurred in most reefs world-wide, often associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o events. Recovery was dependent on the vulnerability of individual reef areas and on the reef's previous history and resilience. At today's level of approximately 387 ppm, allowing a lag-time of 10 years for sea temperatures to respond, most reefs world-wide are committed to an irreversible decline. Mass bleaching will in future become annual, departing from the 4 to 7 years return-time of El Ni{\~{n}}o events. Bleaching will be exacerbated by the effects of degraded water-quality and increased severe weather events. In addition, the progressive onset of ocean acidification will cause reduction of coral growth and retardation of the growth of high magnesium calcite-secreting coralline algae. If CO(2) levels are allowed to reach 450 ppm (due to occur by 2030-2040 at the current rates), reefs will be in rapid and terminal decline world-wide from multiple synergies arising from mass bleaching, ocean acidification, and other environmental impacts. Damage to shallow reef communities will become extensive with consequent reduction of biodiversity followed by extinctions. Reefs will cease to be large-scale nursery grounds for fish and will cease to have most of their current value to humanity. There will be knock-on effects to ecosystems associated with reefs, and to other pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Should CO(2) levels reach 600 ppm reefs will be eroding geological structures with populations of surviving biota restricted to refuges. Domino effects will follow, affecting many other marine ecosystems. This is likely to have been the path of great mass extinctions of the past, adding to the case that anthropogenic CO(2) emissions could trigger the Earth's sixth mass extinction.},

abstract = {Higher taxa often show increasing species richness towards tropical low latitudes, a pattern known as the latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG). A rare reverse LBG (with greater richness towards temperate high latitudes) is exhibited by Gracillariidae leaf-mining moths, in which most described species occur in northern temperate areas. We carried out the first assessment of gracillariid species diversity in two Neotropical regions to test whether the relatively low tropical species diversity of this family is genuine or caused by insufficient sampling and a strong taxonomic impediment. Field surveys in six French Guianan and one Ecuadorian site produced 516 gracillariid specimens that were DNA barcoded to facilitate identification and to match larvae inside leaf mines with adults. Species delineation from sequence data was approximated using Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and Refined Single Linkage Analysis through the Barcode Index Number system, and the proportion of described/undescribed species was estimated after comparison with types of 83{\%} of described species. Locally, alpha-diversity far exceeds that of any known temperate fauna, with as many as 108 candidate species (59.3{\%} as singletons) collected at one site, and with an estimated species richness lower bound of 240 species. Strikingly, at least 85{\%} of the species collected as adults were found to be undescribed. Our sampling represents the most thorough survey of gracillariid species diversity in the Neotropics to date and the results from both our molecular and morphological analyses indicate that the current reverse LBG seen in this group is an artefact of insufficient sampling and a strong description deficit in the Neotropics.},

abstract = {The Stomatopoda (Crustacea: Malacostraca) from the South China Sea region are of commercial importance and although limited studies have been conducted on the adults, no research has ever been attempted on the larval stages because of the lack of identification keys or taxonomic descriptions. In the first study of its kind in the region, DNA barcoding was used successfully to identify unknown stomatopod larvae from plankton samples. Sequences of two mitochondrial genes, namely the cytochrome c oxidase subunit-I (COI) and the large ribosomal subunit (16S) rRNA, were applied as the barcodes to match DNA sequences from unknown larval morphotypes against those of known, locally occurring adult species. Intraspecific variations for the COI and 16S rRNA genes were found to be {\textless}2.4{\%} and {\textless}2.1{\%} respectively in terms of Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) divergence of the adults, whereas variations between genera ranged from 13{\%} to 24{\%} and 3{\%} to 11{\%} respectively. These results imply that both genes are suitable for use in species identification of stomatopods; thus 14 of the 16 larval morphotypes (87.5{\%}) obtained in Hong Kong waters can be identified to seven species through DNA barcoding. The findings of this study would also facilitate future research on the larval ecology and phylogenetic relationship of these crustaceans.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding is a promising approach to the diagnosis of biological diversity in which DNA sequences serve as the primary key for information retrieval. Most existing software for evolutionary analysis of DNA sequences was designed for phylogenetic analyses and, hence, those algorithms do not offer appropriate solutions for the rapid, but precise analyses needed for DNA barcoding, and are also unable to process the often large comparative datasets. We developed a flexible software tool for DNA taxonomy, named TaxI. This program calculates sequence divergences between a query sequence (taxon to be barcoded) and each sequence of a dataset of reference sequences defined by the user. Because the analysis is based on separate pairwise alignments this software is also able to work with sequences characterized by multiple insertions and deletions that are difficult to align in large sequence sets (i.e. thousands of sequences) by multiple alignment algorithms because of computational restrictions. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this approach with two datasets of fish larvae and juveniles from Lake Constance and juvenile land snails under different models of sequence evolution. Sets of ribosomal 16S rRNA sequences, characterized by multiple indels, performed as good as or better than cox1 sequence sets in assigning sequences to species, demonstrating the suitability of rRNA genes for DNA barcoding.},

In addition these gains for biodiversity conservation, the Chagos/BIOT MPA also offers subsidiary opportunities to act as a fisheries management tool for the western Indian Ocean, considering its size and location.

This paper reviews the increasing body of evidence to demonstrate that positive, measurable reserve effects exist for pelagic populations and that migratory species can benefit from no-take marine reserves.},

abstract = {The Chagos Archipelago designated as a no-take marine protected area in 2010, lying about 500 km south of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, has a high conservation priority, particularly because of its fast recovery from the ocean-wide massive coral mortality following the 1998 coral bleaching event. The aims of this study were to examine Symbiodinium diversity and distribution associated with scleractinian corals in five atolls of the Chagos Archipelago, spread over 10,000 km(2). Symbiodinium clade diversity in 262 samples of seven common coral species, Acropora muricata, Isopora palifera, Pocillopora damicornis, P. verrucosa, P. eydouxi, Seriatopora hystrix, and Stylophora pistillata were determined using PCR-SSCP of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), PCR-DDGE of ITS2, and phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that Symbiodinium in clade C were the dominant symbiont group in the seven coral species. Our analysis revealed types of Symbiodinium clade C specific to coral species. Types C1 and C3 (with C3z and C3i variants) were dominant in Acroporidae and C1 and C1c were the dominant types in Pocilloporidae. We also found 2 novel ITS2 types in S. hystrix and 1 novel ITS2 type of Symbiodinium in A. muricata. Some colonies of A. muricata and I. palifera were also associated with Symbiodinium A1. These results suggest that corals in the Chagos Archipelago host different assemblages of Symbiodinium types then their conspecifics from other locations in the Indian Ocean; and that future research will show whether these patterns in Symbiodinium genotypes may be due to local adaptation to specific conditions in the Chagos.},

abstract = {Coral reefs, considered the rainforests of the seas, are home to a diverse number of marine species. These reefs are tightly woven ecosystems with complex linkages, which, if disturbed, result in an unpleasant chain of events. Furthermore, these reefs are the main source of animal protein for more than a billion people. Aside from supplying food, they stabilize shorelines and protect the land from rising seas and storm damage. Also, they provide sources of medicines used for bone grafts and treatment for certain viruses. However, these reefs are in danger of being permanently damaged as a result of natural and man-made forces. In response to this threat, most marine scientists have suggested that local communities be involved in the implementation and management of programs, with the aim of achieving sustainable reef maintenance. In addition, international agencies have taken the initiative to finance such programs to ensure their continuity. Overall, the management and development of coastal ecosystems depend on how they are managed and not on how they are being exploited. Resources must be rebuilt and their protection ensured for future generations.},

Most species live in symbiotic relationships with other marine organisms, such as sponges, corals and crinoids, and some sponge-dwelling species have a highly organized, social structure. The present study is the first worldwide molecular phylogenetic analysis of Synalpheus, based on {\textgreater}2,200 bp of sequence data from two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and two nuclear (PEPCK and 18S) loci. Our molecular data show strong support for monophyly of three out of six traditionally recognized morphology-based species groups: the S. brevicarpus, S. comatularum and S. gambarelloides groups. The remaining three species groups (S. paulsoni, S. neomeris and S. coutierei groups) are non-monophyletic in their current composition and will need to be either abandoned or taxonomically redefined. We also identified potential cryptic species of Synalpheus in our dataset, using intraspecific and interspecific sequence variation in COI from the taxonomically well-studied S. gambarelloides group to establish a genetic divergence threshold. We then used both genetic divergence and tree-based criteria (reciprocal monophyly) to identify potential cryptic species in the remaining taxa of the genus. Our results suggest the presence of multiple cryptic lineages in Synalpheus, underlining the need for more integrative taxonomic studies-including morphological, ecological, molecular, and color pattern data-in this biologically interesting genus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the limits and population dynamics of closely related sibling species in the marine realm is particularly relevant in organisms that require management. The crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci, recently shown to be a species complex of at least four closely related species, is a coral predator infamous for its outbreaks that have devastated reefs throughout much of its Indo-Pacific distribution. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this first Indian Ocean-wide genetic study of a marine organism we investigated the genetic structure and inferred the paleohistory of the two Indian Ocean sister-species of Acanthaster planci using mitochondrial DNA sequence analyses. We suggest that the first of two main diversification events led to the formation of a Southern and Northern Indian Ocean sister-species in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene. The second led to the formation of two internal clades within each species around the onset of the last interglacial. The subsequent demographic history of the two lineages strongly differed, the Southern Indian Ocean sister-species showing a signature of recent population expansion and hardly any regional structure, whereas the Northern Indian Ocean sister-species apparently maintained a constant size with highly differentiated regional groupings that were asymmetrically connected by gene flow. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Past and present surface circulation patterns in conjunction with ocean primary productivity were identified as the processes most likely to have shaped the genetic structure between and within the two Indian Ocean lineages. This knowledge will help to understand the biological or ecological differences of the two sibling species and therefore aid in developing strategies to manage population outbreaks of this coral predator in the Indian Ocean.},

abstract = {We explore impacts on pristine atolls subjected to anthropogenic near-field (human habitation) and far-field (climate and environmental change) pressure. Using literature data of human impacts on reefs, we parameterize forecast models to evaluate trajectories in coral cover under impact scenarios that primarily act via recruitment and increased mortality of larger corals. From surveys across the Chagos, we investigate the regeneration dynamics of coral populations distant from human habitation after natural disturbances. Using a size-based mathematical model based on a time-series of coral community and population data from 1999-2006, we provide hind- and forecast data for coral population dynamics within lagoons and on ocean-facing reefs verified against monitoring from 1979-2009. Environmental data (currents, temperatures) were used for calibration. The coral community was simplified into growth typologies: branching and encrusting, arboresent and massive corals. Community patterns observed in the field were influenced by bleaching-related mortality, most notably in 1998. Survival had been highest in deep lagoonal settings, which suggests a refuge. Recruitment levels were higher in lagoons than on ocean-facing reefs. When adding stress by direct human pressure, climate and environmental change as increased disturbance frequency and modified recruitment and mortality levels (due to eutrophication, overfishing, pollution, heat, acidification, etc), models suggest steep declines in coral populations and loss of community diversification among habitats. We found it likely that degradation of lagoonal coral populations would impact regeneration potential of all coral populations, also on ocean-facing reefs, thus decreasing reef resilience on the entire atoll.},

abstract = {In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), local communities are increasingly assuming responsibility for inshore marine resources either on their own or through collaborative management arrangements with governments or non-state actors. In this paper, we trace the evolution and expansion of community management in the WIO and present the first ever inventory and assessment of the region's locally managed marine areas (LMMAs). We compare the key attributes of these areas to those under government stewardship and assess their relative contributions to progress towards the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) target of 10{\%} of marine and coastal ecological regions to be effectively conserved by 2020. We also explore the legal frameworks that underpin locally managed marine initiatives in Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania to assess the potential for future expansion. A principal finding is that whilst LMMAs protect more than 11,000 square kilometres of marine resource in the WIO, they are hampered by underdeveloped local and national legal structures and enforcement mechanisms. In our recommendations to improve local management, we suggest establishing a network of LMMA practitioners in the WIO region to share experiences and best practice.},

abstract = {A correlation of species and genetic diversity has been proposed but not uniformly supported. Large-scale DNA barcoding provides qualitatively novel data to test for correlations across hierarchical levels (genes, genealogies and species), and may help to unveil the underlying processes. Here we analyse sequence variation in communities of aquatic beetles across Europe ({\textgreater}5,000 individuals) to test for self-similarity of beta diversity patterns at multiple hierarchical levels. We show that community similarity at all levels decreases exponentially with geographic distance, and initial similarity is correlated with the lineage age, consistent with a molecular clock. Log-log correlations between lineage age, number of lineages, and range sizes, reveal a fractal geometry in time and space, indicating a spatio-temporal continuum of biodiversity across scales. Simulations show that these findings mirror dispersal-constrained models of haplotype distributions. These novel macroecological patterns may be explained by neutral evolutionary processes, acting continuously over time to produce multi-scale regularities of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Tropical reefs shelter one quarter to one third of all marine species but one third of the coral species that construct reefs are now at risk of extinction. Because traditional methods for assessing reef diversity are extremely time consuming, taxonomic expertise for many groups is lacking, and marine organisms are thought to be less vulnerable to extinction, most discussions of reef conservation focus on maintenance of ecosystem services rather than biodiversity loss. In this study involving the three major oceans with reef growth, we provide new biodiversity estimates based on quantitative sampling and DNA barcoding. We focus on crustaceans, which are the second most diverse group of marine metazoans. We show exceptionally high numbers of crustacean species associated with coral reefs relative to sampling effort (525 species from a combined, globally distributed sample area of 6.3 m(2)). The high prevalence of rare species (38{\%} encountered only once), the low level of spatial overlap (81{\%} found in only one locality) and the biogeographic patterns of diversity detected (Indo-West Pacific{\textgreater}Central Pacific{\textgreater}Caribbean) are consistent with results from traditional survey methods, making this approach a reliable and efficient method for assessing and monitoring biodiversity. The finding of such large numbers of species in a small total area suggests that coral reef diversity is seriously under-detected using traditional survey methods, and by implication, underestimated.},

abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of obligate mutualisms on coral reef ecosystems, little is known about the evolution of many participating species. The shrimp gobies, known primarily from the coral reef habitats of the Indo-Pacific, are small benthic fishes that participate in a remarkable mutualism with alpheid shrimp. In this mutualism, the shrimp build and maintain a burrow that is guarded by the goby, and the shrimp and goby engage in an intricate tactile communication system. The mutualism is obligate for most shrimp gobies as participating species are highly vulnerable to predation when separated from a shrimp partner. We use phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data to infer evolutionary relationships among shrimp gobies, and between shrimp gobies and their non-mutualistic gobiid relatives. We show that the mutualist shrimp association has arisen twice among gobies, once in a clade composed of Amblyeleotris, Ctenogobiops, and Vanderhorstia, and a second time in a clade including Cryptocentrus, Mahidolia, Tomiamichthys and Stonogobiops. We then compare the evolution of traits within each shrimp goby clade and consider their intrarelationships. We document cryptic diversity among shrimp gobies, with three distinct clades delineated among Mahidolia mysticina specimens captured at the same locality, paired with the same shrimp species. Mahidolia is placed as sister to the Cryptocentrus species Cryptocentrus cinctus; both exhibit pronounced dichromatism, occurring in both brown and yellow (xanthic) forms. We additionally clarify species identities within Amblyeleotris, confirming that widespread similar species Amblyeleotris fasciata, Amblyeleotris steinitzi and Amblyeleotris wheeleri are all distinct. We hypothesize that the flexibility of gobiid gobies and alpheid shrimp to interact with mutualist partners, as well as the apparently highly beneficial nature of mutualism between them, has contributed to the dual evolution of shrimp-association among Indo-Pacific gobies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We combine 25 years of natural history observations in northwestern Costa Rica with morphological study and DNA barcoding of museum specimens to show that A. fulgerator is a complex of at least 10 species in this region. Largely sympatric, these taxa have mostly different caterpillar food plants, mostly distinctive caterpillars, and somewhat different ecosystem preferences but only subtly differing adults with no genitalic divergence. Our results add to the evidence that cryptic species are prevalent in tropical regions, a critical issue in efforts to document global species richness.

We are convinced that the sole prospect for a sustainable identification capability lies in the construction of systems that employ DNA sequences as taxon 'barcodes'. We establish that the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) can serve as the core of a global bioidentification system for animals. First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low-density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species-level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100{\%} successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost-effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification. Its assembly will also generate important new insights into the diversification of life and the rules of molecular evolution.},

abstract = {There is a push to fully document the biodiversity of the world within 25 years. However, the magnitude of this challenge, particularly in marine environments, is not well known. In this study, we apply DNA barcoding to explore the biodiversity of gonodactylid stomatopods (mantis shrimp) in both the Coral Triangle and the Red Sea. Comparison of sequences from 189 unknown stomatopod larvae to 327 known adults representing 67 taxa in the superfamily Gonodactyloidea revealed 22 distinct larval operational taxonomic units (OTUs). In the Western Pacific, 10 larval OTUs were members of the Gonodactylidae and Protosquillidae where success of positive identification was expected to be 96.5{\%}. However, only five OTUs could be identified to species and at least three OTUs represent new species unknown in their adult form. In the Red Sea where the identification rate was expected to be 75{\%} in the Gonodactylidae, none of four larval OTUs could be identified to species; at least two represent new species unknown in their adult forms. Results indicate that the biodiversity in this well-studied group in the Coral Triangle and Red Sea may be underestimated by a minimum of 50{\%} to more than 150{\%}, suggesting a much greater challenge in lesser-studied groups. Although the DNA barcoding methodology was effective, its overall success was limited due to the newly discovered taxonomic limitations of the reference sequence database, highlighting the importance of synergy between molecular geneticists and taxonomists in understanding and documenting our world's biodiversity, both in marine and terrestrial environments.},

abstract = {Recent excitement over the development of an initiative to generate DNA sequences for all named species on the planet has in our opinion generated two major areas of contention as to how this 'DNA barcoding' initiative should proceed. It is critical that these two issues are clarified and resolved, before the use of DNA as a tool for taxonomy and species delimitation can be universalized. The first issue concerns how DNA data are to be used in the context of this initiative; this is the DNA barcode reader problem (or barcoder problem). Currently, many of the published studies under this initiative have used tree building methods and more precisely distance approaches to the construction of the trees that are used to place certain DNA sequences into a taxonomic context. The second problem involves the reaction of the taxonomic community to the directives of the 'DNA barcoding' initiative. This issue is extremely important in that the classical taxonomic approach and the DNA approach will need to be reconciled in order for the 'DNA barcoding' initiative to proceed with any kind of community acceptance. In fact, we feel that DNA barcoding is a misnomer. Our preference is for the title of the London meetings--Barcoding Life. In this paper we discuss these two concerns generated around the DNA barcoding initiative and attempt to present a phylogenetic systematic framework for an improved barcoder as well as a taxonomic framework for interweaving classical taxonomy with the goals of 'DNA barcoding'.},

abstract = {Coral reef cryptofauna are a diverse group of metazoan taxa that live within intra- and inter-skeletal voids formed by framework structures. Despite a hypothesized high biomass and numerous trophic roles, they remain uncharacterized relative to exposed reef communities. Motile cryptofauna were sampled from live coral colonies and dead frameworks typifying four successive levels of degradation on an eastern Pacific pocilloporid reef. Abundances and biomass were higher on live versus dead corals habitats. The density of cryptofauna per volume substrate was highest on dead coral frameworks of intermediate degradation, where complex eroded substrates provide abundant shelters. These data have important and far-reaching ramifications for how the diverse multispecies assemblages that are reef ecosystems will respond to anthropogenic stressors such as those associated with climate change. Extreme levels of coral mortality, bioerosion, and habitat destruction will lead to impairment and eventually loss of ecosystem functions.},

abstract = {The first North American RAD Sequencing and Genomics Symposium, sponsored by Floragenex (http://www.floragenex.com/radmeeting/), took place in Portland, Oregon (USA) on 19 April 2011. This symposium was convened to promote and discuss the use of restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing technologies. RAD sequencing is one of several strategies recently developed to increase the power of data generated via short-read sequencing technologies by reducing their complexity (Baird et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2009; Andolfatto et al. 2011; Elshire et al. 2011). RAD sequencing, as a form of genotyping by sequencing, has been effectively applied in genetic mapping and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses in a range of organisms including nonmodel, genetically highly heterogeneous organisms (Table 1; Baird et al. 2008; Baxter et al. 2011; Chutimanitsakun et al. 2011; Pfender et al. 2011). RAD sequencing has recently found applications in phylogeography (Emerson et al. 2010) and population genomics (Hohenlohe et al. 2010). Considering the diversity of talks presented during this meeting, more developments are to be expected in the very near future.},

abstract = {Traditional mixed stock analyses use morphological, chemical, or genetic markers measured in several source populations and in a single mixed population to estimate the proportional contribution of each source to the mixed population. In many systems, however, different individuals from a particular source population may go to a variety of mixed populations. Now that data are becoming available from (meta)populations with multiple mixed stocks, the need arises to estimate contributions in this 'many-to-many' scenario. We suggest a Bayesian hierarchical approach, an extension of previous Bayesian mixed stock analysis algorithms, that can estimate contributions in this case. Applying the method to mitochondrial DNA data from green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the Atlantic gives results that are largely consistent with previous results but makes some novel points, e.g. that the Florida, Bahamas and Corisco Bay foraging grounds have greater contributions than previously thought from distant foraging grounds. More generally, the 'many-to-many' approach gives a more complete understanding of the spatial ecology of organisms, which is especially important in species such as the green turtle that exhibit weak migratory connectivity (several distinct subpopulations at one end of the migration that mix in unknown ways at the other end).},

abstract = {Direct estimates of larval retention and connectivity are essential to understand the structure and dynamics of marine metapopulations, and optimize the size and spacing of reserves within networks of marine-protected areas (MPAs). For coral reef fishes, while there are some empirical estimates of self-recruitment at isolated populations, exchange among sub-populations has been rarely quantified. Here, we used microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based parentage analysis to assess the relative magnitude of self-recruitment and exchange among eight geographically distinct sub-populations of the panda clownfish Amphiprion polymnus along 30 km of coastline near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. In addition, we used an assignment/exclusion test to identify immigrants arriving from genetically distinct sources. Overall, 82 per cent of the juveniles were immigrants while 18 per cent were progeny of parents genotyped in our focal metapopulation. Of the immigrants, only 6 per cent were likely to be genetically distinct from the focal metapopulation, suggesting most of the connectivity is among sub-populations from a rather homogeneous genetic pool. Of the 18 per cent that were progeny of known adults, two-thirds dispersed among the eight sub-populations and only one-third settled back into natal sub-populations. Comparison of our data with previous studies suggested that variation in dispersal distances is likely to be influenced by the geographical setting and spacing of sub-populations.},

abstract = {Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with complex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Evidence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed dispersal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differential postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental ecological processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.},

abstract = {With today's technology for production of molecular sequences, DNA taxonomy and barcoding arose as a new tool for evolutionary biology and ecology. However, their validities still need to be empirically evaluated. Of most importance is the strength of the correlation between morphological taxonomy and molecular divergence and the possibility to define some molecular thresholds. Here, we report measurements of this correlation for two mitochondrial genes (COI and 16S rRNA) within the sub-phylum Crustacea. Perl scripts were developed to ensure objectivity, reproducibility, and exhaustiveness of our tests. Our analysis reveals a general correlation between molecular divergence and taxonomy. This correlation is particularly high for shallow taxonomic levels allowing us to propose a COI universal crustacean threshold to help species delimitation. At higher taxonomic levels this correlation decreases, particularly when comparing different families. Those results plead for DNA use in taxonomy and suggest an operational method to help crustacean species delimitation that is linked to the phylogenetic species definition. This pragmatic tool is expected to fine tune the present classification, and not, as some would have believed, to tear it apart.},

abstract = {Concentrations of biodiversity, or hotspots, represent conservation priorities in terrestrial ecosystems but remain largely unexplored in marine habitats. In the open ocean, many large predators such as tunas, sharks, billfishes, and sea turtles are of current conservation concern because of their vulnerability to overfishing and ecosystem role. Here we use scientific-observer records from pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to show that oceanic predators concentrate in distinct diversity hotspots. Predator diversity consistently peaks at intermediate latitudes (20-30 degrees N and S), where tropical and temperate species ranges overlap. Individual hotspots are found close to prominent habitat features such as reefs, shelf breaks, or seamounts and often coincide with zooplankton and coral reef hotspots. Closed-area models in the northwest Atlantic predict that protection of hotspots outperforms other area closures in safeguarding threatened pelagic predators from ecological extinction. We conclude that the seemingly monotonous landscape of the open ocean shows rich structure in species diversity and that these features should be used to focus future conservation efforts.},

abstract = {We have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called "Velvet," to manipulate de Bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Sequence-based methods to delimit species are central to DNA taxonomy, microbial community surveys and DNA metabarcoding studies. Current approaches either rely on simple sequence similarity thresholds (OTU-picking) or on complex and compute-intensive evolutionary models. The OTU-picking methods scale well on large datasets, but the results are highly sensitive to the similarity threshold. Coalescent-based species delimitation approaches often rely on Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and can therefore only be applied to small datasets.

RESULTS: We introduce the Poisson tree processes (PTP) model to infer putative species boundaries on a given phylogenetic input tree. We also integrate PTP with our evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA-PTP) to count the number of species in phylogenetic placements. We compare our approaches with popular OTU-picking methods and the General Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model. For de novo species delimitation, the stand-alone PTP model generally outperforms GYMC as well as OTU-picking methods when evolutionary distances between species are small. PTP neither requires an ultrametric input tree nor a sequence similarity threshold as input. In the open reference species delimitation approach, EPA-PTP yields more accurate results than de novo species delimitation methods. Finally, EPA-PTP scales on large datasets because it relies on the parallel implementations of the EPA and RAxML, thereby allowing to delimit species in high-throughput sequencing data. Availability and implementation: The code is freely available at www.exelixis-lab.org/software.html. .},

A new Timetree Wizard in MEGA6 facilitates this timetree inference by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) to specify the phylogeny and calibration constraints step-by-step. This version also contains enhanced algorithms to search for the optimal trees under evolutionary criteria and implements a more advanced memory management that can double the size of sequence data sets to which MEGA can be applied.

abstract = {The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding is a recent and widely used molecular-based identification system that aims to identify biological specimens, and to assign them to a given species. However, DNA barcoding is even more than this, and besides many practical uses, it can be considered the core of an integrated taxonomic system, where bioinformatics plays a key role. DNA barcoding data could be interpreted in different ways depending on the examined taxa but the technique relies on standardized approaches, methods and analyses. The existing reference towards a common way to treat DNA barcoding data, analyses and results is the Barcode of Life Data Systems. However, the scientific community has produced in the recent years a number of alternative methods to manage barcoding data. The present work starts from this point, because users should be aware of the consequences their choices produce on the results. Despite the fact that a strict standardization is the essence of DNA barcoding, we propose a tour of six questions to improve the users' awareness about the method, the correct use of concepts and alternative tools provided by scientific community.},

abstract = {Recent investigations suggest that marine biodiversity may be much higher than earlier estimates, and an important hidden source of diversity in marine systems is the phenomenon of cryptic species complexes. Such complexes are informative models for research into the evolutionary processes that govern species compositions of marine fauna. The snapping shrimp genera Alpheus and Synalpheus are known to harbour large numbers of cryptic species; here, I characterize the genetic structure of the Alpheus armillatus species complex in the northern Caribbean, west Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data. Over this geographical region, the complex harbours at least three lineages that are probable reproductively isolated species; all major lineages diverged subsequent to the close of the Isthmus of Panama. Only one lineage was present in the Gulf of Mexico, whereas outside the Gulf of Mexico there was no clear tendency for lineage dominance by geographical region, as most sites were populated by shrimp from at least two lineages. However, within each lineage, there was strong evidence of population genetic differentiation between geographical regions. All lineages showed strong signals of demographic expansion, and one lineage showed sharply reduced genetic diversity, suggestive of past population bottlenecks or recently founded populations with low gene flow from other sites. These results show that evolutionary processes leading to divergence and speciation have been common and recent in the snapping shrimp, and suggest that connectivity among shrimp populations may be limited.},

abstract = {We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Coral Triangle (CT), bounded by the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula, and New Guinea, is the epicenter of marine biodiversity. Hypotheses that explain the source of this rich biodiversity include 1) the center of origin, 2) the center of accumulation, and 3) the region of overlap. Here we contribute to the debate with a phylogeographic survey of a widely distributed reef fish, the Peacock Grouper (Cephalopholis argus; Epinephelidae) at 21 locations (N = 550) using DNA sequence data from mtDNA cytochrome b and two nuclear introns (gonadotropin-releasing hormone and S7 ribosomal protein).

RESULTS: Population structure was significant ($\Phi$ST = 0.297, P {\textless} 0.001; FST = 0.078, P {\textless} 0.001; FST = 0.099, P {\textless} 0.001 for the three loci, respectively) among five regions: French Polynesia, the central-west Pacific (Line Islands to northeastern Australia), Indo-Pacific boundary (Bali and Rowley Shoals), eastern Indian Ocean (Cocos/Keeling and Christmas Island), and western Indian Ocean (Diego Garcia, Oman, and Seychelles). A strong signal of isolation by distance was detected in both mtDNA (r = 0.749, P = 0.001) and the combined nuclear loci (r = 0.715, P {\textless} 0.001). We detected evidence of population expansion with migration toward the CT. Two clusters of haplotypes were detected in the mtDNA data (d = 0.008), corresponding to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with a low level of introgression observed outside a mixing zone at the Pacific-Indian boundary.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the Indo-Pacific Barrier, operating during low sea level associated with glaciation, defines the primary phylogeographic pattern in this species. These data support a scenario of isolation on the scale of 105 year glacial cycles, followed by population expansion toward the CT, and overlap of divergent lineages at the Pacific-Indian boundary. This pattern of isolation, divergence, and subsequent overlap likely contributes to species richness at the adjacent CT and is consistent with the region of overlap hypothesis.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding has attracted attention with promises to aid in species identification and discovery; however, few well-sampled datasets are available to test its performance. We provide the first examination of barcoding performance in a comprehensively sampled, diverse group (cypraeid marine gastropods, or cowries). We utilize previous methods for testing performance and employ a novel phylogenetic approach to calculate intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence. Error rates are estimated for (1) identifying samples against a well-characterized phylogeny, and (2) assisting in species discovery for partially known groups. We find that the lowest overall error for species identification is 4{\%}. In contrast, barcoding performs poorly in incompletely sampled groups. Here, species delineation relies on the use of thresholds, set to differentiate between intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence. Whereas proponents envision a "barcoding gap" between the two, we find substantial overlap, leading to minimal error rates of approximately 17{\%} in cowries. Moreover, error rates double if only traditionally recognized species are analyzed. Thus, DNA barcoding holds promise for identification in taxonomically well-understood and thoroughly sampled clades. However, the use of thresholds does not bode well for delineating closely related species in taxonomically understudied groups. The promise of barcoding will be realized only if based on solid taxonomic foundations.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are biodiverse ecosystems structured by abiotic and biotic factors operating across many spatial scales. Regional-scale interactions between climate change, biogeography and fisheries management remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated large-scale patterns of coral communities in the western Indian Ocean after a major coral bleaching event in 1998. We surveyed 291 coral reef sites in 11 countries and over 30Â° of latitude between 2004 and 2011 to evaluate variations in coral communities post 1998 across gradients in latitude, mainland-island geography and fisheries management. We used linear mixed-effect hierarchical models to assess total coral cover, the abundance of four major coral families (acroporids, faviids, pocilloporids and poritiids), coral genus richness and diversity, and the bleaching susceptibility of the coral communities. We found strong latitudinal and geographic gradients in coral community structure and composition that supports the presence of a high coral cover and diversity area that harbours temperature-sensitive taxa in the northern Mozambique Channel between Tanzania, northern Mozambique and northern Madagascar. Coral communities in the more northern latitudes of Kenya, Seychelles and the Maldives were generally composed of fewer bleaching-tolerant coral taxa and with reduced richness and diversity. There was also evidence for continued declines in the abundance of temperature-sensitive taxa and community change after 2004. While there are limitations of our regional dataset in terms of spatial and temporal replication, these patterns suggest that large-scale interactions between biogeographic factors and strong temperature anomalies influence coral communities while smaller-scale factors, such as the effect of fisheries closures, were weak. The northern Mozambique Channel, while not immune to temperature disturbances, shows continued signs of resistance to climate disturbances and remains a priority for future regional conservation and management actions.},

abstract = {This study assesses the biogeographic classification of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) on the basis of the species diversity and distribution of reef-building corals. Twenty one locations were sampled between 2002 and 2011. Presence/absence of scleractinian corals was noted on SCUBA, with the aid of underwater digital photographs and reference publications for species identification. Sampling effort varied from 7 to 37 samples per location, with 15 to 45 minutes per dive allocated to species observations, depending on the logistics on each trip. Species presence/absence was analyzed using the Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient, followed by cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling. Total (asymptotic) species number per location was estimated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Three hundred and sixty nine coral species were named with stable identifications and used for analysis. At the location level, estimated maximum species richness ranged from 297 (Nacala, Mozambique) to 174 (Farquhar, Seychelles). Locations in the northern Mozambique Channel had the highest diversity and similarity, forming a core region defined by its unique oceanography of variable meso-scale eddies that confer high connectivity within this region. A distinction between mainland and island fauna was not found; instead, diversity decreased radially from the northern Mozambique Channel. The Chagos archipelago was closely related to the northern Mozambique Channel region, and analysis of hard coral data in the IUCN Red List found Chagos to be more closely related to the WIO than to the Maldives, India and Sri Lanka. Diversity patterns were consistent with primary oceanographic drivers in the WIO, reflecting inflow of the South Equatorial Current, maintenance of high diversity in the northern Mozambique Channel, and export from this central region to the north and south, and to the Seychelles and Mascarene islands.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying species of organisms by short sequences of DNA has been in the center of ongoing discussions under the terms DNA barcoding or DNA taxonomy. A C-terminal fragment of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) has been proposed as universal marker for this purpose among animals. RESULTS: Herein we present experimental evidence that the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene fulfills the requirements for a universal DNA barcoding marker in amphibians. In terms of universality of priming sites and identification of major vertebrate clades the studied 16S fragment is superior to COI. Amplification success was 100{\%} for 16S in a subset of fresh and well-preserved samples of Madagascan frogs, while various combination of COI primers had lower success rates.COI priming sites showed high variability among amphibians both at the level of groups and closely related species, whereas 16S priming sites were highly conserved among vertebrates. Interspecific pairwise 16S divergences in a test group of Madagascan frogs were at a level suitable for assignment of larval stages to species (1-17{\%}), with low degrees of pairwise haplotype divergence within populations (0-1{\%}). CONCLUSION: We strongly advocate the use of 16S rRNA as standard DNA barcoding marker for vertebrates to complement COI, especially if samples a priori could belong to various phylogenetically distant taxa and false negatives would constitute a major problem.},

abstract = {Population connectivity plays significant roles on both evolutionary and ecological time-scales; however, quantifying the magnitude and pattern of exchange between populations of marine organisms is hindered by the difficulty of tracking the trajectory and fate of propagules. We explored biophysical correlates of population substructure to determine how well pelagic larval duration (PLD) correlates with population genetic estimates of connectivity in a sample of 300 published studies drawn pseudo-randomly from about 1600 hits on electronic searches. In direct contrast to the general expectation of a strong correlation, we find that average PLD is poorly correlated (r2 {\textless} 0.1) with genetic structure (FST). Furthermore, even this weak correlation is anchored by non-pelagic dispersal, because removal of the zero PLD class (direct developers) from the analysis resulted in a non-significant relationship between FST and PLD. For species in which minimum, maximum, and mean PLDs were available, it is noteworthy that both minimum and maximum PLDs are better correlated with FST than the mean larval duration, which has been used in all such previous studies. A 3-way ANCOVA reveals that genetic marker class (allozymes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA sequences), as opposed to habitat or swimming ability, explain most of the variation in FST (F = 7.113, df = 2, p = 0.001), with higher values of FST obtained from mtDNA than with either microsatellites or allozymes (which were not significantly different). Our meta-analysis refutes recent reviews and conventional wisdom that PLD is a good predictor of the magnitude of gene flow and geographic scale of population structure in marine systems.

abstract = {We examine estimates of dispersal in a broad range of marine species through an analysis of published values, and evaluate how well these values represent global patterns through a comparison with correlates of dispersal. Our analysis indicates a historical focus in dispersal studies on low-dispersal/low-latitude species, and we hypothesize that these studies are not generally applicable and representative of global patterns. Large-scale patterns in dispersal were examined using a database of correlates of dispersal such as planktonic larval duration (PLD, 318 species) and genetic differentiation (FST, 246 species). We observed significant differences in FST (p{\textless}0.001) and PLD (p{\textless}0.001) between taxonomic groups (e.g. fishes, cnidarians, etc.). Within marine fishes (more than 50{\%} of datasets), the prevalence of demersal eggs was negatively associated with PLD (R2=0.80, p{\textless}0.001) and positively associated with genetic structure (R2=0.74, p{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, dispersal within marine fishes (i.e. PLD and FST) increased with latitude, adult body size and water depth. Of these variables, multiple regression identified latitude and body size as persistent predictors across taxonomic levels. These global patterns of dispersal represent a first step towards understanding and predicting species-level and regional differences in dispersal, and will be improved as more comprehensive data become available.},

abstract = {The effects of water temperature during the pelagic life-history phase on body character-istics at metamorphosis and settlement were examined for the tropical goatfish Upeneus tragula (Mul-lidae). Water temperatures were recorded daily at 2 stations on the northern Great Barrier Reef from April 1989 to May 1990. Temperature data were used to calculate an estimate of temperature history for individual newly metamorphosed goatfishes from 10 samples, collected at 5 stations across the northern Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Accounting for mean water temperature experienced during the larval phase reduced the within-sample vanability in growth rates by 30{\%}. There were significant neg-ative relationships with mean water temperature for both standard length and age of fish at metamor-phosis within and among samples. Adjusting for temperature history by analysis of covariance markedly changed the patterns of size at settlement among sampling stations. Use of a summation of daily water temperatures over the larval period of each fish as an estimate of physiological age (in degree-days) also changed the patterns of significance among sampling stations compared to patterns found using age (d) alone. These results suggested the importance of temperature in determining lar-val patterns of growth. An experiment examined the influence of water temperature on size, age, body composition and muscle development at settlement. Larval U. tragula were collected and placed ran-domly in 3 tanks at each of 2 temperatures. 25 and 30Â°C. Fishes were fed ad libitum and removed from tanks upon metamorphosis and settlement Fishes in the 30Â°C water settled on average 2.8 d earlier than those in the 25Â°C tanks. The length, weight, muscle development and biochemical composition of fishes did not differ between temperature regimes. Together, the field and laboratory results suggest that relatively small changes in water temperature have the potential to greatly influence the patterns of variability seen in the age and size at metamorphosis in many tropical reef fishes. Developmental rate to metamorphosis appears to be more affected by water temperature than fish length.},

abstract = {We deployed three replicate larval light traps off the upper Florida Keys from June-September 2001 to measure the delivery of settlement-stage fish larvae to the coral reefs. Nightly measures of larval abundance were compared to water temperatures measured across the outer reef, nearby wind records, and the alongshore and cross-shelf components of the currents measured at the seaward edge of the reef. These time series, together with satellite- derived sea surface temperature and color fields indicate that a very large multi-taxa larval pulse on 20 July was directly associated with the passage of a Florida Current (FC) sub-mesoscale frontal eddy embedded within the elongated remnant of a mesoscale eddy. A second large pulse of larvae occurred when a similar mesoscale eddy passed the upper Keys in mid-June. Periods of increased tidal bore activity occurred with the passage of these eddies. Semidiurnal internal tides caused near-bottom onshore intrusions of cooler slope waters during periods of onshore meanders of the FC front when the downstream baroclinic flow and stratification increased at the reef margin. The high abundance and similarity in larval ages within taxa on 20 July indicate a Keys shelf origin, although the temporal and spatial scales of entrainment cannot be resolved. The passage of a third mesoscale eddy in September did not result in a larval pulse, possibly because of a mismatch between biological and physical criteria, several of which must be met for larval transport by mesoscale eddies to be successful.},

abstract = {Larvae have been difficult to study because their small size limits our ability to understand their behavior and the conditions they experience. Questions about larval transport focus largely on (a) where they go [dispersal] and (b) where they come from [connectivity]. Mechanisms of transport have been intensively studied in recent decades. As our ability to identify larval sources develops, the consequences of connectivity are garnering more consideration. Attention to transport and connectivity issues has increased dramatically in the past decade, fueled by changing motivations that now include management of fisheries resources, understanding of the spread of invasive species, conservation through the design of marine reserves, and prediction of climate-change effects. Current progress involves both technological advances and the integration of disciplines and approaches. This review focuses on insights gained from physical modeling, chemical tracking, and genetic approaches. I consider how new findings are motivating paradigm shifts concerning (1) life-history consequences; (2) the openness of marine populations, self-recruitment, and population connectivity; (3) the role of behavior; and (4) the significance of variability in space and time. A challenge for the future will be to integrate methods that address dispersal on short (intragenerational) timescales such as elemental fingerprinting and numerical simulations with those that reflect longer timescales such as gene flow estimates and demographic modeling. Recognition and treatment of the continuum between ecological and evolutionary timescales will be necessary to advance the mechanistic understanding of larval and population dynamics.},

Demographic and genetic contributions from nonspecific immigrants tend to reduce ex-tinction rates of insular populations. The MacArthur-Wilson model of island biogeography is modified to provide for this effect of immigration on extinction, which we call the rescue effect. This new model predicts that when immigration rates are high relative to extinction rates, turnover rate is directly related to the distance between an island and the source of colonizing species. A field study of the distribution of arthropods among isolated plants supports the model.},

abstract = {The traditional view that species are held together through gene flow has been challenged by observations that migration is too restricted among populations of many species to prevent local divergence. However, only very low levels of gene flow are necessary to permit the spread of highly advantageous alleles, providing an alternative means by which low-migration species might be held together. We re-evaluate these arguments given the recent and wide availability of indirect estimates of gene flow. Our literature review of F(ST) values for a broad range of taxa suggests that gene flow in many taxa is considerably greater than suspected from earlier studies and often is sufficiently high to homogenize even neutral alleles. However, there are numerous species from essentially all organismal groups that lack sufficient gene flow to prevent divergence. Crude estimates on the strength of selection on phenotypic traits and effect sizes of quantitative trait loci (QTL) suggest that selection coefficients for leading QTL underlying phenotypic traits may be high enough to permit their rapid spread across populations. Thus, species may evolve collectively at major loci through the spread of favourable alleles, while simultaneously differentiating at other loci due to drift and local selection.},

abstract = {Genetic testing is recommended for patients with phaeochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) because of their genetic heterogeneity and heritability. Due to the large number of susceptibility genes associated with PCC/PGL, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is ideally suited for carrying out genetic screening of these individuals. New generations of DNA sequencing technologies facilitate the development of comprehensive genetic testing in PCC/PGL at a lower cost. Whole-exome sequencing and targeted NGS are the preferred methods for screening of PCC/PGL, both having precise mutation detection methods and low costs. RNA sequencing and DNA methylation studies using NGS technology in PCC/PGL can be adopted to act as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers as well as in planning targeted epigenetic treatment of patients with PCC/PGL. The designs of NGS having a high depth of coverage and robust analytical pipelines can lead to the successful detection of a wide range of genomic defects in PCC/PGL. Nevertheless, the major challenges of this technology must be addressed before it has practical applications in the clinical diagnostics to fulfill the goal of personalized medicine in PCC/PGL. In future, novel approaches of sequencing, such as third and fourth generation sequencing can alter the workflow, cost, analysis, and interpretation of genomics associated with PCC/PGL.},

@article{Quail2012,
abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized genomic and genetic research. The pace of change in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's PGM, Pacific Biosciences' RS and the Illumina MiSeq. Here we compare the results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the Illumina HiSeq, the current market leader. In order to compare these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7{\%}. Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in terms of coverage distribution, bias, GC distribution, variant detection and accuracy. Sequence generated by Ion Torrent, MiSeq and Pacific Biosciences technologies displays near perfect coverage behaviour on GC-rich, neutral and moderately AT-rich genomes, but a profound bias was observed upon sequencing the extremely AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum on the PGM, resulting in no coverage for approximately 30{\%} of the genome. We analysed the ability to call variants from each platform and found that we could call slightly more variants from Ion Torrent data compared to MiSeq data, but at the expense of a higher false positive rate. Variant calling from Pacific Biosciences data was possible but higher coverage depth was required. Context specific errors were observed in both PGM and MiSeq data, but not in that from the Pacific Biosciences platform. All three fast turnaround sequencers evaluated here were able to generate usable sequence. However there are key differences between the quality of that data and the applications it will support.},

abstract = {Sampling markers throughout a genome with restriction enzymes emerged in the 2000s as reduced representation shotgun sequencing (RRS). Rapid advances in sequencing technology have since spurred modifications of RRS, giving rise to many derivatives with unique names, such as RADseq. But naming conventions have often been more creative than consistent, with unclear criteria for recognition as a unique method resulting in a proliferation of names characterized by ambiguity. We conducted a literature review to assess methodological and etymological relationships among restriction enzyme-based methods, as well as rates of correct referencing of commonly-used methods. We identify several instances of methodological convergence or misattribution in the literature, and note that many published derivatives have modified only minor elements of parent protocols. We urge greater restraint in naming derivative methods, to strike a better balance between clarity, recognition of scientific innovation, and correct attribution.},

abstract = {Report of a conference of zoo biologists and systematists in which Evolutionary Significant Unit was coined to include some well defined subspecies. Problem of subspecies: anecdotal accounts among mammalogists of different subspecies being named from the same litter; on the other hand, Chinese and Indian muntjac deer subspecies that are sterile when crossed. "Identification of ESUs was recognized as a difficult task, requiring the use of natural history information, morphometrics, range and distribution data, as well as protein electrophoresis, cytogenetic analysis, and restriction mapping of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The recognition of inevitable uncertainty in the classification of potentially significant populations led to a recommendation that concordance between sets of data derived by different techniques be a criterion identifying ESUs, Thus, when geographic distribution data indicate the existence of discrete populations within the range of a species, an estimate of genetic distance, for example, should be made to determine whether the populations have ESU status."},
